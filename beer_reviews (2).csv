Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Colorado,4.67/5,"A small pour, ebony dark, no real head. Intense, rich aroma, brownies and German chocolate cake; dark sweetness. The taste amplifies the smell with the addition of sublime Kentucky bourbon. Heavy body; dense, chewy residual sugar feel with a sublime whiskey heat.

This beauty was generously provided by @azuelke (Adam) at a bottle share hosted by @GreenBayBA in Sheboygan, WI. There were many great beers sample, many beautiful and exquisite dark beers, but nothing quite like this legendary beer. If ever you have a chance to try this one, all I can say is don't pass it up. The beer lives up to its legendary status.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Iowa,5/5,"Vintage 2022, served on tap at Toppling Goliath in a ""snulip"" glass. Opaque deep blackish brown in color, with garnet highlights and a wisp of tan head. Where to start? Notes of cocoa, molasses, licorice, cherry cola, and maple syrup. The bourbon/barrel was, surprisingly, quite understated. Full body, almost syrupy, with good carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. This finishes cleanly, with hints of roasted malt, maple syrup, and molasses lingering on the finish. This was incredibly easy drinking and not at all boozy despite the high ABV, and it was so good that I wanted to lick the glass clean. World class all the way.","Dec 04, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Illinois,5/5,"I didnt think i was going to give it a perfect score but..... Its looks, smells, tastes, a 5, HOWEVER, the mouth feel is NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUAL TO LOOK SMELL AND TASTE. Pardon me i have to sit down. Mouth feel is, well 11. Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before. It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'. It tasted familiar-- like real, pure butter on real Belgium-chocolate, buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries, real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, served with Seattle coffee, and a shot of pappy.","May 10, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Pennsylvania,3.79/5,"So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”
Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?
So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too. 
The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care. 
After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful. 
Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant. 
Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…","Mar 11, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Massachusetts,4.65/5,"2021 vintage, bottle #79

Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?

Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing

The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon

Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness

I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA!","Feb 26, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Massachusetts,4.27/5,"Celebrating my buddy @Rug with his 1,000th beer review. Pours an almost perfect black with no head. Smells lightly of maple syrup and chocolate. With the first sip I immediately tasted chocolate and caramel followed by a maple syrup finish. The syrup flavor lingers. The feel department is where this stout lacks. Feels very light, which is good for me as someone not too fond of stouts and lagers but to the avid fan of a heavier beer, this one may disappoint. Overall great beer and I’m glad I got to crack it open with my bud.","Feb 26, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,New York,4.79/5,"Thick and syrupy pour, mocha head. Aroma is boozy maple, bittersweet chocolate.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Oklahoma,4.96/5,"Initial nose is beautiful maple! The taste is nice barrel, maple, coffee and chocolate. This is very rich and overall deserving of the high ratings. The only slight knock on this beer is viscosity.","Jan 10, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,New Jersey,4.23/5,"A: Nightfall in appearance that presents a class, of shades, within the Bearded Iris: Before the Storm. Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission 

S: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins

T: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions

M: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques

O: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step","Jan 01, 2022"

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Utah,4.49/5,"Draft pour at TG. 

Pitch black with no head. Not too thick. At the nose is heavy maple with some coffee. I didn’t really pick up any barrels though. The taste is likewise the same, heavy maple with coffee and chocolate. Very little barrel as it warmed. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Not too thin nor too thick. Overall: a standard BA breakfast stout. Great beer overall but over hyped with ridiculous pricing. Glad I had a draft pour which cost less per oz than the bottle.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,,Iowa,5/5,"This review is for the 2019 batch. It was bottle number 43, tasted as part of a dinner at Toppling Goliath.

Vanilla Bean Assassin,,New Jersey,4.68/5,"Unofficially my last beer of the top 250 (had the trade secured for it before changes were made to calculations, making me 20 short again...)

It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black. It has a finger and a half head of tight, thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout. Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled.

Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow. Fudgey brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak all follow. There's just a hint of figs linger in the background.

The flavor is quite bourbon forward, but very round and smooth. It's like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel, artisan fudge, and a shot of high end bourbon. Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon, but this is quite well balanced.

The mouth feel is thick, but not overly so. It's slick and coats the mouth well, lingering and begging you to take another sip. Just the right amount (only a touch) of carbonation, and a bone dry, slightly boozy finish. Superb!

Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink, and a worthy one for my ""last"" of the 250 list! It doesn't blow me away in the flavor department, but it does in its balance and roundedness! Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts! The fact that I could EASILY solo dome this bottle says something!","Jan 13, 2022"
Vanilla Bean Assassin,,Florida,5/5,"As far as vanilla barrel ages stouts go, it is hard to name a better one than this. Very sweet, but just short of cloying.

It is a fudge vanilla cake like flavor. The depth of the flavor was incredible. I arrived at 11:30 and took tell two to finish the flight.

I had this along with a draft pour of KBBS at the same time. The VB Assassin is definitely a lot different than KBBS, besides the adjuncts obviously. VB Assassin was pitch black with a bit of foam around the edge of glass. Aroma had loads of vanilla along with bourbon booze a bit maybe.

S - Small notes of vanilla with chocolate as well as light notes of whiskey. Hard to compare because I have not had regular assassin but smell is pretty damn good

T - Taste follows the nose although the vanilla is somewhat muted. It blends in with the milk and dark chocolate flavors that come through from the base. Definitely some hints of coffee in there and some bourbon on the finish although it is not that prevalent.

M - Mouthfeel is pretty thick and vicious, not as thick as KBBS and MD but it is definitely a thicker BA stout which I love

Marshmallow Handjee,,Massachusetts,4.6/5,"2022 vintage, bottle 1316/3500

Another milestone review, number 1800! I figured since I have the highest rated RIS on BA just sitting around that it would be a perfect time to break it out. This is my first of any Dark Lord variant, and I think it’s a damn good place to start for the series. Let’s pop this legend open and see what it has to offer

Pours almost completely pitch black with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The roast is real in this one, but it’s wonderfully offset by the sweeter notes as well. I’m picking up on aromas of drip coffee, burnt caramel, dark toast, milk chocolate, tobacco, vanilla bean, molasses, toasted oak, fig, and light cinnamon

It’s similar in taste, but with even more of a depth, making this one hell of a complex beer. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, vanilla bean, sweetened coffee, toasted oak, fig, maple syrup, burnt caramel, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, black cherry, and marshmallow. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, charred oak, maple syrup, burnt caramel, black cherry, fig, vanilla bean, allspice, sweet bourbon, marshmallow, dark toast, and tobacco

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of boozy heat

Oh yeah, this is amazing. Thankfully a beer that lives up to the hype. Maybe one day I’ll splurge on another bottle","Jul 28, 2023"

Marshmallow Handjee,,Pennsylvania,4.83/5,"Just because it can't be perfect, I guess, but it's damn close.

L:I was looking for Marshmallow Handjee. Looked for awhile. Looks cool in the bottle and better in my wine glass.
S: Mmmmm - did I see it can't be perfect? The nose on this gem is as close as it gets. Before the characteristic Dark Lord depth, there is the vanilla-creamy-sweet-smores thing going. And that's just the easy part. The complex, fine barrel notes compete with the earthy black malts and I love every moment of the struggle. If oil came from barley, this would fuel jets.
T: No surprises because the smell telegraphs the taste like an amateur against Ali. More of the vanilla sweet cocoa gram up front followed by the bourbon twisted chocolate caramel espresso of a great stout. It's all here.
F: It's like chewing bubble gum that never gets boring nor loses its flavor. Heavy like the punch that aforementioned amateur caught on the jaw though. Sloooww sipper.
Overall this is how it's done. An adjunct stout is never my first choice but, when done right, you get something like this. I don't like it better than the straight up WWS or some of the other simple, three ingredient brews, but it is damn good.","May 07, 2022"
Marshmallow Handjee,,Missouri,4.64/5,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well.

Remarkable how little this tastes like a regular Darklord. It's fairly sweet which i generally don't like, but the barrel presence compensates enough to make it really enjoyable.

Marshmallow Handjee,,Kentucky,4.59/5,"Brewing pastry stouts before pastry stouts were cool, the imperial stout that Dark Lord used to be has trended sweeter, more sultry, heavier and stronger as time has passes. Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it.

With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip.

Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste.","Dec 27, 2021"

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,,Washington,4.31/5,"This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time now (was able to obtain it in a trade for Fremont B5K).

The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer certainly looks impressive enough. On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer). That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well. It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting.

This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it. Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again.","Mar 18, 2022"

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,,Missouri,4.64/5,"Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021.

Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.

The barrel notes become more pronouned as it warms, particularly the apple brandy.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,,Minnesota,4.2/5,"2016 batch (#2) reviewed.

Hunahpu's is one of those beers that I loved the very first time I tried it, and I've been chasing that dragon ever since... unsuccessfully, as it turns out.

I've been lucky enough to try Barrel-aged Huna twice now - once at Great American Beer Fest, and for a second time when I won a bottle in a charity raffle. As it turns out, I drank my BA Huna alongside of Double Barrel Huna, expecting that I would be blown away by the Double Barrel... in fact, it was the exact opposite experience.

And perhaps I should have expected that, given the barrels used in DB Huna - Rum and Apple Brandy barrels don't often tend to impart much thickness to a beer, and in combination, they definitely made the beer seem a bit thin. Additionally, where the bourbon barrels in BA Huna add depth, richness, sweetness, and complexity, it seems that Double Barrel just took on thinness and acidity. It's also quite charred in taste - it reminded me quite a bit of my gripes with 2018 Huna. Sadly, all of that cinnamon and vanilla that I love seemed to be entirely absent. It's still a sweet beer, but it's greatly overshadowed by the barrel notes and char and acidity.

In the end, I honestly think I've found myself preferring non-barrel-aged Huna as my go-to. It's certainly easier to get, and something about it is just a much more pleasant experience for me. Yes, I have a sweet tooth, so that's probably a big part of it. Or perhaps Cigar City's aging methods just aren't to my liking. Maybe the barrels? Tough to say - more experimentation required!","Aug 06, 2018"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,,Maine,4.99/5,"Pours a jet engine oil dark body with a mocha-hued head.

Brandy and rum blend together nicely to add some complexity to the richness of the nibs. The chiles and cinnamon are very noticeable as well, but are balanced out by the chocolate and alcohol so it's never too overpowering.

Taste is quite complex, lots of chocolate and rum noticeable at first, with a decent bit of cinnamon and vanilla coming through as well. The chili really grows as you drink and the beer warms. Quite noticeable in the aftertaste in a really pleasant way. Quite a bit of warm boozyness there as well, but very smooth and mellow at the same time. Mouthfeel really is fantastic, very thick, sticky, almost oily and very smooth. I was considering waiting for CBS for my 100th review, but I think this one will do nicely. The barrel-aging really did wonders to the quite overrated Hunapuh here, adding a certain complexity from the brandy and rum notes along with making the chili stand out more and generally mellowing out the beer, creating a richer harmony.

Blessed,,Indiana,4.85/5,"Pours squid ink black and settles in the glass like a black velvet cloak, stopping all light, sitting under a sudsy dark tan head that dissipates quickly, as expected with a beer of this gravity. Absolutely gorgeous imperial stout.

I don’t know if the nose of a beer can be decadent, but this beer’s nose is, with rich cocoa and vanilla notes up front, some dark cherries, and a sledgehammer of oak and barrel notes.

The taste is led by the vanilla and cocoa notes, and they are rich and chewy, moving into the dark cherry flavors to cut the sweetness a bit, and then finishing with the oak and a welcome boozy warming from the three bourbon barrels featured in this beer.

The mouthfeel is as rich and decadent as a gooey bourbon soaked brownie sitting in a dip of vanilla ice cream. I can’t imagine a more perfect rendering of a BA imperial stout.","Aug 01, 2023"
Blessed,,Kentucky,4.83/5,"If Woodford Reserve, Willet and Heavenly Hill were to get together and make a beery baby, they would be so blessed to have this stout. Slumbering away for extended aging these three barrels give Anchorage Brewing a love child that can compete with the best.

Jet black and pouring like inky tar, Blessed pours with a luscious, ominous and velvety pour. While shy on froth the overwhelming scent of molasses, chocolate, whisky, oak, coconut and cream align with stronger scents of coffee and campfire. Once on the tongue, the immense sweetness of molasses, brown sugar and fudge carry and nearly brownie-batter taste with those sweeter bourbon barrels playing a maple and coconut sweetness.

As the sweeter flavors swirl on the tastebuds, notions of mound and almond joy pop off of the middle palate while the malts remain juicy and plush. Trailing into a smooth espresso, cappuccino character, the late taste brings out all of those coconut, toasted oak, vanilla, cherry and savory smoke to have the session trending warm, sultry and savory set of pleasantries.

Full bodied, pillowy and fortified with nearly port-like proportions, the stout is simply magical. It pushes the boundaries in what is a fully malted imperial stout before pushing into the pastry realm. The warmth of whisky is soothed with caramel malts, vanilla and coconut and balances the sheer malts with utter ease.","Jul 19, 2023"

Blessed,,Massachusetts,4.76/5,"This is ridiculously delicious - the nose is pure bourbon-soaked brownie batter, and it couldn’t be better; the palate was more of the same, with some mild nuttiness and marshmallows too; pretty awesome mouthfeel; barely any heat on finish.","Jan 13, 2023"
Blessed,,Missouri,4.51/5,"Pours black with a finger of dark caramel colored foam. Oily legs clings to the glass long after each swirl of the used motor-oil looking liquid. The look personifies heft and thickness. Aroma is coconut and vanilla bean, with roasty, toasty, and mild nutty malts following closely behind. It has a sweet start that is quickly curtailed by a cut of whiskey and char. These roasty qualities pair well with the additional thick chocolate and and caramel notes. Flavor profile is coconut, chocolate, vanilla bean, toffee, and heavy roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon and char add to the mix, without cutting or overdeveloping heat. Smooth coconut and vanilla bean is present throughout, bringing with them a little twist of sweetness. Mouth feel is thick, nearing velvety in texture. The weight of the beer stamps it out short of being creamy. Overall, coconut notes are great here, pairing up well with whiskey. There is a lot to it, and yet it remains simplified and laser focused on the task of providing a heavy stout with addition of coconut and vanilla bean.

Blessed,,Massachusetts,4.55/5,"Batch 2, 2022

Oh man, here we are. The highest rated beer from Alaska, and 8th highest rated overall on BA. Getting Anchorage beers is always a treat, but I’m expecting this one to go beyond a treat. Let’s pop this bad boy open

Pours a very dark muddy brown with a finger of reddish dark brown head that immediately fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but decent sheeting

To call the nose decadent would be a massive understatement, I could smell this one from the second I cracked it and the aroma filled the room. I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple

While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge. The swallow brings notes of chocolate cake, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, sweet bourbon, fresh oak, fruity coffee, dates, and burnt caramel

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky with a touch of boozy heat but nothing overbearing

This is truly an awesome beer. I'm sure many will complain that batch 1 was better or some stupid shit like that, but having had only this one, it's amazing. What a treat, cheers BA!","May 30, 2022"
Blessed,,California,4.52/5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with insanely dark brown head. The head disappeared within seconds, leaving an array of very small coconut chunks floating on top. Looks fantastic. 

The nose is absolutely insane. Thick layers of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, marshmallow, a touch of maple, figs, and more sweet fudge. This is definitely on the sweet side, but it just smells thick and creamy. 

The taste is marvelous. In addition to the vanilla, fudge, coconut, and bourbon, some of the roasted malts from the base stouts comes through. Marshmallow and some dark fruit. The coconut is definitely on the toasted side, at least that is what comes through. Some burnt toffee, a touch of coffee grounds, and some oak bitterness on the back end. Overall, this hits all the senses and makes for a great ride. Not overly sweet on the taste. 

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Long aftertaste. Overall, a fantastic BA stout.","May 28, 2022"
Blessed,,Colorado,4.19/5,"Dark, inky body, opaque; carbonation burbles percolate above a flat crown with no head. Very rich, powerful aroma; fudge and milk chocolate; roasted and charred grain; moderate sweetness. Very sweet and spicy taste; cocoa and milk chocolate; vanilla and cinnamon; coconut; raisins and figs; fairly bold alcohol presence simmering beneath the sweetness. Heavy body; slick and chewy; very rich residual sugar feel; some alcohol warmth noted, increasing as the beer warms.

This beer exudes decadence and richness. The overall sweetness is a bit overpowering. I think the alcohol notes are more from the beer's ABV rather than anything from the barrel aging. The lack of any head is also a minus. Still, taste-wise, and overlooking the dominating sweetness, this isn't a bad imperial stout, just lacking some depth and complexity that it really could have it had a bit more balance between the malts, coconut, vanilla, and barrel-aging used in its creation.

Heady Topper,,Canada (ON),4.37/5,"I had a chance to visit the brewery and have Heady Topper on tap, and bring a few home for a more in depth tasting.

Aside from knowing its fame, I knew little else. My first thoughts were it was not quite as hazy as I expected. Secondly, upon tasting I was surprised to find it reminded me more of a western IPA than an NEIPA. Not that its a bad thing, I'm just preferential to hazy beers with grapefruit that you cannot see into. Most of my experience is with NY based NEIPAs which do seem a bit different than Vermont.

Smell - It seemed more floral than fruity. The alcohol content also shone through a bit.

Taste - Wow. No IBU rating on can but this has to be 60+ but not so much as to be a distraction in the taste. The flavor really helps balance the bitterness. The pine and resin was strong, albeit weaker than some great west coast IPA's I have had. This was followed by a complex fruitiness that was beyond me to completely identify. No massive grapefruit or citrus flavor I could identify, maybe a complex mixture of blackberry and blood orange would be the most apt description.

The aftertaste was ... dark, damp, and lasting. In a great way. To me the ten seconds after the drink was probably the best part of the beer. The stronger alcohol content was very warming while the flavor was ... dark, but also releasing more taste as the seconds ticked by.

And I must say I loved the brewery. Beautiful and great staff. I literally stayed a 3 minute walk from it. My only concern was it was a touch small on the inside seating area, the food options were not strong and it closes at 6PM. Another downside (lol) was the number of very good breweries within 15 minutes, I only was able to make one trip here due to committing to other breweries and the early closing hour.","Jul 09, 2023"

I was handed the can but did not drink from the can as the can instructs. I asked for a pint glass. I wanted to see what it looked like!

Well it is a bright hazy yellow color with a fluffy, creamy white head and great curtain lacing. Distinct citrus smell and taste, and slightly floral.

Overall: This one has some complexity for sure. Very good brew. Glad I got this one.","Jun 14, 2023"
Heady Topper,,Texas,4.64/5,"Poured a small portion in a rocks glass to get the look and smell, drank the rest from the can as recommended
Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed orange-yellow color with a billowy off-white head. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is robust with some apricot and grapefruit and a whole mess of resinous pine. Along with these aromas comes nots of herb and a sweeter tangerine, mixed with bits of grass and hay. Some lighter smells of a bready and cracker malt, as well as notes of lemongrass and pepper are there as well. Overall, the aroma is of more dank and inviting fresh hops.
Taste – (note tried both from can and after pour, no discernable difference) – The taste begins with a cracker malt base paired with a whole heap of dank and resinous mix of grapefruit, pine, and herbal hops. The hop flavors are super fresh tasting, having a very, raw, green hop flavor. There are other flavors upfront as well, with notes of apricot, lemon, and peach. As the taste advances the hop flavors get stronger in grapefruit flavor, while the pine weakens just a bit. All the while the body dries out a touch, and in the end one is left with a nice and freshly hopped taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is slightly more creamy and smooth with a moderate carbonation level. Both suit the flavors rather well and make for an awesome sipper.
Overall -This beer is renowned for a reason. It is very flavorful and fresh with a great drinking nature. A winner for sure.","Jun 14, 2023"

O.W.K.,,Alabama,5/5,"2022 Side Project Invitational, 04/09/2022.

A little late compiling my notes together for this beer, but finally getting around to diving into its incredible profile. Fortunate enough to grab two pours of this at Side Project's Inaugural Festival of Barrel-Aged Stouts & Barleywines (2/2/2020).

These pours of O.W.K. were from a March 2018 keg.

In the glass, the motor oil thickness is immediately noticeable. No traces of head or lace to be seen; only small, chestnut brown-colored bubbles that lazily rise in a broken circle around the ring of the beer itself. Swirling it lightly in the glass really shows the density of the body, with wine-like legs trailing slowly in the wake of the quickly motionless liquid.

With this beer approaching two years old, the still-dominant vanilla aromas are amazing. Bordering on pastry, the initial 1-2 punch of vanilla combined with a rich, sweet, chocolate-forward stout base is something to behold. After a moment, however, there's an exquisite bourbon barrel complexity on the backbone that characterizes charred oak and a touch of caramelized dark fruit.

On the palate there is a bit more evidence than the nose that the vanilla has begun to mellow, but it is still complimenting at just the perfect level. As mentioned previously, the barrel character of this beer is unmatched. Lightly earthy cacao does well to soften what can only be described as bourbon-soaked brownie batter. Notes of rich marshmallow fudge, vanilla bean, & charred oak lead the way for a viscous, boozy warmth that can be felt all the way down.

Touching on it briefly, the mouthfeel on this beer is unbelievable. Side Project stands above all at achieving stouts that have the ability to be decadently soft and smooth, thick and chewy, and finish with a boozy warmth all at the same time. O.W.K. is no different. This beer literally coats your mouth, being sure that every taste bud experiences the full essence of what this barrel-aged beauty has to offer, with a chew on the palate and a warmth down the hatch that sticks around well into that inevitable next sip. If you ever get the opportunity, savor it. It might not be too overly dramatic to say that it won't ever get topped.","Feb 03, 2020"
O.W.K.,,Illinois,4.78/5,"original review of b1 (overall 4.54): Sample pour at SP anniversary party. pitch black. no head at all. huge vanilla aroma with some chocolate in the background. this is a vanilla showcase though. even after a year and a half’s time. taste is vanilla and chocolate. the Ugandan beans give it a more frosting or cake icing flavor similar to D13, although i think i liked the nose and taste of that one better. mouthfeel is thick, low carb, sticky. excellent beer, but can’t give it the insane through-the-roof ratings as i just don’t care that much for vanilla stouts. glad to have tried a little pour though.

updated for b2 (2023). poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP BBT22 snifter, i consumed this beer over the course of three days with the help of a wine stopper. kept refrigerated upon purchase and overnight during the weekend of consumption, i let it sit out for quite some time before pouring essentially consuming at room temp. both my sample of 2018 OWK were quite limited but this seems like a different beast altogether. the very low carbonation does allow it to be drank like a glass of red wine (or port wine) although the flavor profile is much more of a vanilla frosted chocolate cake. it is decadent and rich like a glass of good red wine or port. in the years since having b1 i have grown to be a much bigger fan of vanilla in BA imperial stouts, however, i’m pleasantly surprised to find just how in check the vanilla is in this beer. it’s there for sure but it is so well integrated into the beer that it basically acts as a compliment to the chocolate flavors. the barrel is less present on the nose on day 2 and 3 but still there in the taste, especially in the finish. this is an incredible beer.","Dec 15, 2019"
O.W.K.,,Missouri,5/5,"If ever there was a perfect stout, this is it. The most balanced stout one can imagine. Cory is insanely skilled and i’m thankful I had the opportunity to try this one. Delicious on all levels.","Oct 28, 2018"
O.W.K.,,Missouri,5/5,"L - Dark, viscious, coats the glass with some legs on it. One of the thicker beers I've had in recent memory. Dark brown ring around the edge of the glass 

S - Pure Vanilla, Marshmallow and Bourbon. The vanilla dominates on the nose, as it warms you get a fudge and barrel characteristic

T - Vanilla dominates up front, though there was a massive amount of vanilla added to this beer, it is one of the most balanced and complex BA niller stouts I've ever had. Tons of barrel on the finish, but neither are overbearing. 

F - Thick and chewy, coats the mouth with pure vanilla sex leaving you wanting more. 

O - In the top 3 of BA Niller stouts I've ever had. It might be my favorite for the shear fact that even though it's loaded with vanilla it's perfectly balanced with those WIllett Barrels","Aug 07, 2018"

If the sugar plum fairy and Cookie Monster made a baby, I’m sure this is what Mrs. Plum Fairy would lactate. I mean, damn…we are talking sweet. That said, it’s all kinds of balanced and on point like nailing a bullseye at darts before you drain your first beer… What is Raul getting at here? Yeah, he doesn’t play darts.

Mornin' Delight,,Indiana,4.71/5,"Appearance - The beer was black in appearance with a smooth body that showed little visible carbonation and a modest tan head.

Smell - Pancakes were immediately brought to mind with notes of coffee and maples syrup in the nose. It was like breakfast for dinner.

Taste - As with the nose, it was like breakfast for dinner. The maple syrup seemed to saturate the stout, permeating the body. The beer was not overly sweet, but was balanced by the coffee notes. It seemed as though the coffee was washing down the sweetness. Notes of semi-sweet chocolate same toward the back, but the overall profile of chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup lingered. 

Mouthfeel - The body was thick, but not quite motor oil quality. This made the beer more drinkable than the average heavy stout. Carbonation was still very present. 

Overall - The beer was definitely hype worth. Unlike some other TG beers, it was relatively easy to obtain.","Oct 24, 2022"
Mornin' Delight,,Pennsylvania,4.74/5,"2022 Variant - bottle split 4 ways - pours a a rich black with a nice mocha foam into a tulip. Overpowering maple on the nose, and was a little worried that this was going to be too sweet for me, and too much of a dessert stout, but the taste was so well balanced - maple sweetness was well calmed by the roasty coffee and baker's chocolate flavor. 

While MD was easier to obtain this year from a volume perspective, this was not a cheap bottle to get to Pittsburgh haha - overall - well worth it and while some of the shine might have worn off this beer nationally given it's more readily available, it's still a world class pour. Glad I have a bottle left.","Sep 25, 2022"

Look - an aggressive pour into a tulip glass looking like oil with a nice two finger mocha colored head

Smell - the maple, oh the maple! While it dominates, also get some notes of vanilla, toffee and chocolate

Taste - The maple sweetness definitely hits at first bit there is a good balance with some roasty coffee and semi-sweet chocolate flavors. Outstanding 

Mouthfeel - it's thick, syrupy and coats the mouth nicely

Overall - just an absolute world class beer, my only wish is I would've had some waffles or French toast for brunch to pair with it","Jan 31, 2022"

Mornin' Delight,,Massachusetts,4.45/5,"2021 vintage, growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck

Serious question, does Half Time ever disappoint? Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme

In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat

This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thing","Nov 05, 2021"
Mornin' Delight,,Illinois,4.06/5,"Had both 2020 and 2021 on draught. 2020 - the coffee faded quite a bit, the maple is dominant to the point of being a maple bomb.

A NEW BAR HAS BEEN SET. 

I’m not sure how this is so perfect. Warm without being boozy, sweet but balanced beauty. With all the extras, the backbone is a well developed stout. This is a magic experience. 

I am blown away that anyone could complain about the $15 pour. Most of NYC just had a mediocre pinot noir for $15 and found that normal. This may be the very best pour value in the city. Go in before it’s gone. 

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.","Sep 16, 2021"

Mornin' Delight,,Indiana,4.72/5,"Had a fresh ten ounce pour on tap into a tulip glass. The rich and luscious cocoa-colored foam pours two fingers deep over a nearly black base, and slowly dissolves leaving ample lacing coating the surface and the rim of the glass. Powerfully aromatic maple and coffee is detectable a foot away. Bringing the nose in closer reveals underlying notes of chocolate and an intense maple and coffee that is simply about as pleasing as can be expected from a beer. The taste is fresh maple and coffee, chocolate, molasses and syrup with just a hint of roasted malts and hops from the base beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall just short of life changing, but if every coffee stout were this good it would be a better world.","Aug 03, 2021"
Mornin' Delight,,Pennsylvania,4.77/5,"P: deep brownish black with a slight brown head which dissipates, stayed a bit stronger in the draft Bergson 

A: Strong maple syrup goodness with French toast. Draft was pure French toast

T. Sweet maple syrup up front followed by a strong roasted coffee and then gets more mapley on the back end. The coffee was a bit lost in the draft version but I did not miss it. 

M: nothing bad, nothing great. 

O: this is definitely a quality beer. It’s pushing to be overly sweet but the coffee works to balance it well. This definitely would be superb in a barrel.","May 22, 2021"

Mornin' Delight,,Massachusetts,4.86/5,"Maybe its the psychology of how hard this is to come by or how expensive it is but I loved this one! The only points I took off were for how sticky it leaves everything and for lack of a head. The taste is fantastic ... none of the bitterness of a typical beer of its kind, all of the flavour.

If you aren't into sweet beers, this won't be your jam. It takes what Founders Maple Mackinac Fudge does and removes the boozy sting. It tastes like french press coffee, those little maple syrup sugar candies and a bit of chocolate. It keeps the chocolate smooth and without the harsh/bitter pure cocoa notes many stouts these days have.

The colour is black with a slight tan head which dissipates quickly. The beer is syrupy and will leave the glass, your lips and anything you touch sticky like resin. Probably the price to pay for such a delightfully sweet beer.

I had this on draft at Rogue Island in Providence. At $16 for a 12 oz. pour, it's much better than paying $50 for a bottle. Not sure if I would do that despite how good the beer is. I can see why it's in the top 10 but it seems like most/many of the beers in the top 10 are limited releases with improbable obtainability, so maybe psychology and hype brings them to the top of the list. I wish there were more smooth/less harsh breakfast stouts, like this. Funky Buddah had a good one a year ago. If they came out with a version that added a bacon note, I'd probably drive to the brewery to get it.","Feb 15, 2021"
Mornin' Delight,,Illinois,4.54/5,"Maple nose, maple and roasty coffee combo throughout, and a long, lingering finish with a bit of heat. The maple does not overpower and fits in nicely with the coffee and roasty stout base.

Mornin' Delight,,Iowa,4.08/5,"Black like cannon fodder and aroma of maple and caramel. A very pleasant beer but far from the $50 price tag.

Fortunately for me, King Julius found its way into my life, offering a delicious taste of nostalgia that perfectly bridges the gap between my two worlds. King Julius embodies everything I love about New England IPAs: From the moment the can is cracked open, a burst of enticing citrus and tropical aromas wafts through the air, conjuring images of sunny days spent by the serene lakeshores. The vibrant golden hue, reminiscent of a breathtaking sunset, beckons you to dive right in and savor its offerings.
With the first sip, I am transported to my beloved lakeside retreats, where the cares of the world seem to fade away. The velvety-smooth mouthfeel caresses the palate, ensuring each flavor is embraced and cherished. King Julius boasts a harmonious blend of juicy orange, luscious mango, and succulent pineapple that dances across the taste buds, leaving behind a pleasantly lingering sweetness.
One sip evokes a sense of community, as if the spirit of The Lake is somehow infused within its effervescent bubbles.

King Julius,,Massachusetts,4.47/5,"Pours kind of a murky orangish golden, maybe dirty blonde. It's not an attractive NEIPA. The nose is quite nice - mango and papaya permeate. It is definitely citra (mango and papaya) forward with the Tree House yeast also playing a co-starring role providing some bubblegum-like chewiness. It's got some balance too with some pepper on the finish. While containing enough residual sugar to bring out that fruit character, this is still lean to the point that it's not heavy for a DIPA.

Taste on this defiantly follows the nose unlike its small brother Julius big fruity notes on a chewy smoothie base. loads of fruity goodness that was in the nose tangerine, nectars, pineapple, mango all mingled in honey dew sweet malts. finish is light lingering bitterness a orange peel rind with touches of herbal notes to finish it out.

King Julius,,Kentucky,4.6/5,"With utmost radiance, vibrancy and brilliance in its hop display, Tree House's Imperial New England IPA hits hops pinnacle. In a world of princes, they are the king.

And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.

The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.

Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors.","Sep 15, 2022"

King Julius,,New York,4.81/5,"Canned 8/19/22. Warm yellow orange color, totally opaque hazy beer. An inch of just off-white head on top which hangs around a good bit, and laces the glass well. Nose is as advertised, orange cream, mango, honeydew melon, ripe and sweet and a bit floral at the end. There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end. The booze is present, but it plays in the background. The bitterness shines through especially at the end in a really satisfying ""take another sip"" type of way.","Aug 27, 2022"

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.

Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best. 

Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow.... 

Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.

One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!

Cheers, KC!

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,Ohio,4.35/5,"My first sacrifice at Dark Lord Day 2023 (it's back baby!!!), this screenprinted batch 1 Triple Oak label--sporting those the Aussie stickers with pride--poured a mildly viscous clear reddish-copper with nary a head to speak of, though ringed by a bubbly tan chain.

Intensely woody up front, it even leans a little pungent and catty right out of the bottle. However, it quickly transforms into an explodingly delectable maple tempered by a whiskey heat that both continue to expand on the exhale and with each subsequent sip.

Though this definitely shows its age, it's quite the experience nevertheless. Still, I'm not sure anything can beat my nostalgia for the original cognac-only bomber, despite my Double Oak rating being the highest of all three.","May 25, 2023"

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,New Jersey,4.84/5,"This is a special one. I wanted to crack this while reading Brandon Sanderson's ""Tress Of The Emerald Sea"". So I did.

Apppearance is dark brown, just a shade brighter than a cup of coffee. Definitely some translucence. 

Nose is just a cacophony of oak, bourbon, dark bread with plum jam, apple butter, caramel soaked raisins, and coconut. Wow. Simply exquisite. The nose is expressive, but not overbearing. Restrained.

The taste follows the nose perfectly. Sweet, dark fruit, like plum, date and fig, combined with caramel and brown sugar, rich breadiness, oak, apple, cherry, baking spices. Everything works perfectly with each other. 

Mouthfeel is full bodied. Not thick or syrupy either. Not too cloying. A little bit of evaporation to counteract. Some tannins to dry. It fits well in this regard. It doesn't hang too heavy on the palate. 

Overall this is stellar brew. I can't think of many words to really capture how absolutely amazing this experience is. A product crafted by masters in thier field and it shines through brilliantly.","Apr 09, 2023"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,Massachusetts,4.6/5,"2022 vintage

Review 1600! I've saved a truly legendary beer for this milestone review, the highest rated American Barleywine on BA and 13th highest rated overall. I just had the Double Oak version yesterday and it was damn good, so I have high hopes for this. Let's crack this beast open and see what it's all about

Pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a nothing and leaves no lacing, but with fantastic legs

In the nose, it's also quite similar to Double Oak, though with some more barrel presence. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy bourbon, charred oak, molasses, burnt caramel, plum, black cherry, cognac, toasted coconut, sweet vanilla, old leather, light fig, and toffee

The booze is more forward here, but it pushes such wonderful complexities in taste that it actually adds to the experience. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting cocoa powder, black cherry, cognac, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, honey, molasses, dark toast, fig, sweet vanilla, raisin, light toffee, and tobacco. The swallow brings notes of leather, smoky tobacco, charred oak, molasses, fig, black cherry, toasted coconut, port wine, plum, cacao nib, burnt caramel, brown sugar, and light walnut

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a rich and silky beer. Finishes a tad sticky, but the boozy tingle dries it out over time

This is incredible. The Double Oak version was great too, but this one edges it out. Definitely a beer I'll remember for years to come","Apr 08, 2023"

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,Pennsylvania,4.44/5,"Outrageously rich. Ethanol soaked raisens all day... not a whole lot else. I want this in a whiskey bottle that can be recorked and drank on 10 occasions. Not a one off 500ml. Gonna recork this for down the road because its just too rich to drink at once.

Upon finishing this beer I would certainly agree thats its world class. It also is oh so similiar to jw lees harvest ale as its warmed and settled. This is hotter but apart from that I'm hard pressed to say that it has a lot to brag about to certain JW lees vintages (2002 and 2007 harvest ale stick out in my mind as being some of the best ever). 

Cliff notes. Very good beer. Not worth $100. Go buy a $10 JW lees.

Further edit. As I REALLY get to the end of this beer its almost cumbersome. Its fsr too hot and far, still too sweet. Its almost like jungle juice and I'm not even joking.","Dec 03, 2022"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,New York,4.92/5,"Appearance: A Deal with the Devil Triple Oak-Aged Barleywine has a deep amber color with a slight haze. The head is light beige and dissipates quickly.

Aroma: The aroma is a complex mix of sweet toffee and dark fruit, with a hint of vanilla and oak from the triple oak aging process.

Taste: The taste is rich and complex, with notes of dark fruit, caramel, and toffee. The oak aging process provides a subtle vanilla flavor and a slight tannic finish.

Mouthfeel: This barleywine has a medium-to-full body with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel.

Overall Impression: Anchorage Brewing's A Deal with the Devil Triple Oak-Aged Barleywine is a well-balanced and complex barleywine that showcases the intricate flavors and aromas of oak aging.

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,New Jersey,4.25/5,"A: The emergence is dense on lucidity with a materialization that ensues oily margins. Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above

S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length

T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin 

M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms 

O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out time","Jun 29, 2022"

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,New York,5/5,"Absolutely fabulous. Poured fridge cold to a Glencairn glass. Color is dark, deep chestnut. No head that cares to form. Viscous like oil down the side.

Nose is instant strong bourbon, caramel, stone fruits, barrel. Pure fragrant bouquet. 

First sips are all those aromatics converted to gustatory glee. Everything is even more intense than the nose. So much complex flavor, just amazing. It has all the sweetness of an English style, with a surprisingly solid middle foundation of a stout. Balance is perfect. 

Alcohol is prevalent and hot, but so perfectly a bourbon bomb balanced with sweetness and hints of dark chocolate notes. Leaving a mouthful to sit on the tongue for a minute is quite a delight. Explosive flavors!

Mouthfeel is full, heavy, syrupy without any cloying elements at all.

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,California,4.63/5,"Pours a rich amber color, and sits nearly black in the glass. Ominous for a barleywine. Generates a much larger head than I expected, but the 17% ABV destroyed it very quickly.

Initial aromas have so much hot alcohol and dark fruit that it’s almost port-like. It’s tight right out of the bottle. Needs some time in the glass to relax, and you’re greeted with floral vanilla, popsicle stick wood, butterscotch and molasses.

It’s right on the edge of being too sweet. Let this warm up too much, and it may push you off, but at 50° - 55°, it behaves itself. Flavors of sticky toffee pudding, vanilla, oaky coconut, and finishes with an almost Old Fashioned-like boozy citrus peel. Very unique.

Drinks like thick boozy syrup, coating your mouth, and burning all the way down.. to meet the devil himself. It’s the perfect finish for a beer this monstrous.","Dec 31, 2021"
A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,,New York,4.89/5,"2021 vintage, batch 3.

This one pours a golden dark brown color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This smells like honey-drizzled toasty bread, caramel, port, cherry, Heath bars, chocolate, and bourbon.

This is absolutely stellar - an example of everything that can be done with simply high quality barrels and high quality barleywine. It's sticky and sweet, but the barrels add some wonderful dimenson - nuttiness, vanilla, lots of oak spice, along with honey, chocolate, caramel, and rich toffee notes.

This is medium bodied, rich and sticky, with very little booziness. It's super drinkable, considering it's a triple barrel aged 17% barleywine.

Batch 3

I don't comment on appearance much these days, but I have never seen a beer cling to the side of the glass this way. After rolling the glass around, it looks like honey is stuck to the inside of the glass.

Boozy as hell but this does not come across as hot. Sweet, rich, seductive, undiluted bourbon absolutely dominates. I don't remember where I read the following line, it isn't mine but it's apt. This is like bourbon aged in a barleywine barrel. Beyond the dominating bourbon, which I'm loving, there is plenty of sticky caramel, raisin, molasses, honey, vanilla, nougat and much more.

Pours a dark, almost black mahogany. Near no head but with some of the oiliest legs I've seen in a while. Nose is boozy up front. I get hints of molasses, brown sugar, hazelnut, salted caramel, and butterscotch, and chocolate. Great complexity with almost a brininess for balance. Beer opens molasses, caramel, and syrup up front. Boozy and extremely hot on the palate. A second sip yields salted caramel, sweet soy sauce, and more molasses in the middle. Oaky and boozy at the finish with a sticky tobacco and oak presence. DIsplays great complexity, just like the nose, but the booziness needs time to dissipate. Body is full with low carbonation. Oily, slick, and hot on the palate. Goes down hot with a sticky, lingering finish. Perfect for the style.

King JJJuliusss,,Texas,4.39/5,"Poured from a can into a snifter
Appearance- The beer pours a super hazy orange-juice color with a massive puffy white head. The head has a great level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving spiderweb lacing all over the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is huge of an orange rind smell mixed with sweet notes of tangerine and orange as well as plenty of herbal hops and a strong showing of pine and earth. Mixed with thee smells are some juicy pineapple, mango, and papaya with some citrus hop smell with a ruby red grapefruit. Other citrus notes of lemon and lime as well as some bready malt and light grain are there as well, mixing in with some raw hop smells to produce a rather dank and green hoppy smell overall. m
Taste – The taste begins with a thick bready malt flavor that is composed mostly of a smooth wheat, doughy, and oaty flavor. There is also a moderately sizable fruit flavor upfront, with orange and peach being the strongest, but with notes of pear and apple and a hint of lemon in there as well. The hop is strong from the start as well, with a earthy and herbal hop being the most pronounced followed by some notes of pine and floral hops. As the taste advances the pine and herb grown stronger while the earth fades, bringing more dankness to the tongue. That said the sweetness picks up a tad, balancing out the hops rather well, and with some very raw hop and grassy flavors coming on at the end, one is left with a dank, but sweeter and malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and chewy with a moderate to higher carbonation level. Quite nice for the thick and dank tastes of the brew and certainly makes for a nice slow sipper.
Overall –A quite nice and tasty brew with a lot of hop attitude, but a balanced demeaner. While not quite up to the hype, it is certainly a well crafted brew.","Aug 29, 2023"

King JJJuliusss,,Connecticut,4.07/5,"Canned on 8/9/22; consumed on 9/9/22

Pours an opaque, rusted dark orange body capped with two fingers of creamy, off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, moderate, frothy collar, amd layers of chunky, webby lacing encircling the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fresh orange juice sit atop a fluffy malt foundation, soon welcoming peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit peel as undertones of catty dank poke through over time and musty lime eases through the closing impressions.

Taste offers candied grapefruit and sugar-dusted orange as a passionfruit zest meets musty lime to balance a level, tropical citrus overlay, while subtler undertones of fresh peach/mango linger on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-full body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a weighty fluff of glossy resins through the mid-palate; a creamy counterbalance to a largely subdued grit on the back end eases to a soft hop twang and minimal perceptible bitterness through the finish.

Sweet fruit saturation sports detailed edges of earthier dank, and while heavy on the palate, maintains a steady, balanced presentation of ripe, juicy resins throughout.","Sep 09, 2022"

That ripe melon comes on strong again in the taste. A touch of orange citrus, but quite light in comparison. There’s a fleeting flash of spearmint or wintergreen, too, but moderate “green,” twiggy bitterness is what lingers, melding with the cantaloupe through the aftertaste — maybe some grass, maybe some herbs, but definitely some hop burn.

It’s not as aggressively tart as some lambics/gueuzes, likely subdued by the cask asking. Other characters I get are red grapes, tart citrus, moderate spice. Just fantastic, so much going on, and the finish is divine. 5

M/D: Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Carbonation lower than most in the style but insanely drinkable. 4.25

O: A gem of a beer. Well worth the hype. An elite beer. 4.75","Sep 03, 2022"
Zenne Y Frontera,,Massachusetts,4.54/5,"Batch 5, Blend 49, Season 17|18, Bottled 4/11/18

Review 1200!!! For this landmark review, I'm tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA, which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site. This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now, so I'm happy I managed to source a bottle. I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes, as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference. I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating, but I'm sure that will be the decanted version. Let's pop it open

Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing. Expected for the style, and I don't think decanting will make a difference in this regard

The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move, as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first. Pre-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of peat smoke, leather, oxidized sherry, wet hay, and white wine vinegar. Post-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, tart peach, white peppercorn, oxidized sherry, wet hay, wheat cracker, toasted oak, light smoke, and stone

The same applies for taste, this is super funky and almost aggressive pre-decant. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, olorosso sherry, sharp oak, leather, sweet honey and light smoke. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, wet hay, old leather, vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, and apple skin. Post-decant, it really opens up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, pear skin, oxidized sherry, toasted oak, earthy wheat, wet hay, and a touch of peat smoke. The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry, peat smoke, wet hay, lemon zest, tart peach, wheat bread, stone, light leather and sharp oak

Much like the appearance, I don't think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel. A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and funky beer. Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk. This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it, but obviously I wouldn't do that

Wow, this is truly awesome stuff. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised, I knew what I was getting into, but it was an absolute honor. Paired wonderfully with a smoked bleu cheese and fig pecan crackers. I couldn't think of a better beer for 1200. Cheers BA!","Jul 24, 2022"
Zenne Y Frontera,,Missouri,4.65/5,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass.

Pours a beautiful gold color with a light haziness to the transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam. Aroma is sherry and barrel right off the cusp. Funky stone, lemon, and earthy notes round it out with a light funky nose. Sherry smooths things out, elevating the whole nose from base, while delivering stronger, more potent notes of dried fruit. Flavor profile builds on the nose, hitting sherry and barrel character first. Stone, lemon, tangy green apple, and earthy notes round it out - again. There is a sublime twist of funky tartness that does well to give the whole flavor profile an additional dimension. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Texture is driven by a consistent, smooth, even texture. Overall, just a splendid beer, in each terms of complexity, quaffability, and thoughtfulness. Lovely.

Zenne Y Frontera,,Canada (QC),4.25/5,Bottle: Poured a dark golden color lambic with a medium size foamy head. Aroma of funky ester with some barnyard notes and some woody vinous notes.

Zenne Y Frontera,,New York,4.49/5,"750ml capped and corked Batch 2 SOLERA bottle into 3F stemware. Shared with friends. 

Nose is barnyard, hay, cheese, lemon zest, and cobwebs. This is what funk is all about. Super aromatic and crazy funky. Beer opens light funk. I get notes of hay, lemon zest, oak, wet wood, and peat. More hay and cobwebs in the middle. Musty and straw. Lemon and oak at the finish. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Prickly and still lively on the palate and goes down accented and sparkling. Goes down slightly dry with a lingering, filmy aftertaste. 

Very, very solid. I'm pretty impressed. Definitely worth having.","Nov 20, 2020"
Zenne Y Frontera,,Michigan,5/5,Doesn't get better than this!,"Oct 20, 2020"
Zenne Y Frontera,,Ohio,4.59/5,"Having this (season 18|19 blend 92) side-by-side with regular Oude Geuze (season 18|19 blend 69), for maximum contrast, Zenne is a much darker amber, with a short khaki head that settles to a thin off-white ring.

The nose is nougat and nutty dusty musty walnut to the nth degree.

Taste exhibits sweet honey and caramel characteristics, and upon intermingling with the sherry barrels, this emulates a caramel apple and even mulled cider, all while maintaining starkly savory notes attributed to the barrel. This puppy is dry af, and also a bit more acidic than OG, yet simultaneously more complex, especially as it warms. Even still, it maintains in the background those classic toasted cracker and grapefruity 3F properties.

As mentioned, the contrast between regular OG and this is astounding. While the Oude Geuze is simply more drinkable, effervescent, and lightly brightly clean, I can see how a brew like this stands out from the crowd and makes a very uniquely intriguing impression. At the same time, I can't imagine solo doming a whole bottle of this, it's just so complex. Sharing is the move here.

In December of 2021, I shared a blend 93 from the same season 18|19, and found the experience to be a revelation.

The foggy burnt gold to amber body builds a short but fuzzy off-white head that settles to a persistent ring.

Both more toasty of that unique 3F seediness and also more tart, tangy and juicy of orange and apricot qualities than the last vintage I remember, this bottling is actually crazy refreshing and delicious, while not as funky, musty and woody as my prior experience.

The medium body contains a fine fizz and comes to a semi-dry finish that's a little chewy and slightly stinging, where hints of raspberry even crop up. Nutty oak does slowly emerge with time, but this gueuze's overall translation is brighter and juicier than blend 92.

I'm compelled to increase my original 4.29 score quite substantially based on this bottle, which was stored horizontally in my cellar and acquired in the same release as the above reviewed bottle, undisturbed since then. While time in the bottle may have been a factor in its development, (and, might I add, this is the only style I can wholeheartedly endorse intentionally aging in the first place), I feel I'm getting a more well-rounded sense of what Zenne is about as well. I have another blend to try at some other date, and now I just can't wait. I might give it yet another year, though.

In June of 2023, we enjoyed a new blend 93, from season 21|22 this time, freshly released on site in Lot. It was very toasted seed and nut forward with an underlying touch of nougat and dusty dusty dusty oak. It actually manages to somehow exude a much older vibe than the 1998 vintage we had just before it, but with a lovely lovely froth and a little grapefruit acidity. It's just so intensely nutty!!! This, ultimately, is my overall impression of what Zenne boils down to. If it ain't nutty from that sherry, then it ain't Zenne.","Oct 13, 2020"

Zenne Y Frontera,,New Jersey,4.6/5,"A: Decanted orange pour with red, and bottom gold highlights. The collar is softly white in practice, and rounds to ½ an inch before dissipating to a dynamic lace

S: Aroma is encapsulated thru sherry wet cobblestones, dungeon cobwebs, and a musty oak chest. Progression is ongoing amid fruited cherries, cellar peach, apricot kernels, and pear skins with backed wooded tea leaves. The integration is in sync, with balanced acidity on more green skins to an indirect Melon presence on growth

T: Proficient harmonization on palate, where notes are fully characterized with lean minerality. The lemon peel, citrus rind, and apricot crisp continue on the basement webbing alongside a catacomb of grape funk - subtle notes of white peppered pistachio skins, sesame seeds, cored peaches and sharp, cardamom spiced nectarines come out in length

A complex and unusual lambic, very unique character from the sherry barrel-aging.
Bright golden orange, thin layer of foam and spotty lacing.

Aroma is intense, woody oak, light acidic citrus, and complex caramelized sugars.

Tart and supple, lemony grapefruit lambic notes, and nutty dried fruit sherry notes meld in perfect harmony. So smooth and flavorful, it makes you slow down and enjoy every sip. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall this is really exceptional, and a masterful concept of Armand Debelder. Wishing him well in retirement. Thanks to Adam for sharing this one!

Tastes of barnyard funk with fruity notes of lemon peel and orange, the sherry barrel is noticed mid-palate, adding dried dark fruits, even a hint of a nutty element.

If you like Lambics (and Geuze) I think you will agree.

Pliny The Younger,,New York,4.86/5,"I've been chasing this beer for the better part of 13 years. Today was finally the day. 500ml capped bottle into a Fuzzy IPA glass. 

Pours crystal clear goldenrod with a slowly building 2 finger foamy white head that sits around. Patchy, stringy lace sticks to the inside of the glass. Nose is citrus, pine, grass, and sap. Fresh, aggressive, resiny. Very pungent. Beer opens grass, pine, and citrus. Zesty towards the middle with loads of fresh pine, unripened tropical fruit, and tree sap. Finishes with a crystal clean bitterness that is dry and lingers in the aftertaste. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate, and goes down dry with a lingering, sticky aftertaste.

Pliny The Younger,,Pennsylvania,4.8/5,"The first thing that stands out is how ordinary this looks. It's a bright light amber color with a modest white head. Served in a clear half pint glass from a tap in Philadelphia, at first glance, one would wonder about all the fuss. The aroma is mildly piney, again there's no reason to get too excited. Then, to taste it and realize what all the acclaim is about. It is dry hop dominate, but there is a substantial malt backbone. It manages to provide a nice malt counterbalance without becoming too sweet, nor earthy. The substantial hop bite is piney, but dry and incredibly clean. There's little lacing inside the glass and there's even less notice of the 10.25% ABV. This deserves its reputation as among the best.","Feb 24, 2023"

I actually prefer my westies a little more bitter, but this beer does indeed work fantastically. Overall, a great beer and glad I finally got to taste it.

Pliny The Younger,,California,4.8/5,"Appearance: Pours a brilliant rich golden color, with a soft white foam head.

Aroma: Sweet earthy piney notes, mild and pleasant tropical fruits and pine resin. Rich Bready malts.

Taste: citrus and tropical fruit, makes way for a balance of pine, herbal, and floral hops. Slightly boozie toward the end. Some sweetness balanced with a good, strong bitter finish gives it best of both worlds. 

Overall opinion: this is an amazing beer. It lives up to the hype. Very hoppy, but it isn't all up in your face about it. It's like a smooth sailing Hoppy adventure on your pallet. Both the aroma and the taste has some incredible complexity. I give it 5 out of 5. Hands down one of the best IPA experiences I've had.","Feb 17, 2023"

Pliny The Younger,,Missouri,4.61/5,"Pours a slight dark gold with a light frost to the transparency. Head is a couple fingers of plush white foam. 

Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits, citrus, and mild resin and grass. It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic, dynamic, quick-hitting aroma. Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile, but are faint in comparison to the hops. Hops are never loud, instead, they land at a mild volume of ""six"" on a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. Instead of using volume, hops are overlapped to create complexity. 

Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset, sharing the spotlight with resiny, grassy, piney, and mild herbal and floral hops, before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish. Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms, but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy. It's never overtly sweet, nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end, as do some west coast IPAs. Instead, the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops. That dryness is accompanied by bready malts. 

Mouth feel is medium-thick with a consistent, crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence. It's just thick enough to drink more like an experience, and less like a parking lot, tailgating IPA - though I would never turn down a pour / bottle of this in the latter situation. 

Overall, this beer embodies wonderful balance, along with thoughtful nuance, to create a dreamy smooth IPA. Hops are pleasant, plump, and forward, without carrying the pedal-to-the-metal force of some other IPAs. This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance.

It was the Cadillac of Russian River. This time I called the server over. ""Are you sure this is it? Not Happy Hops or something else?"". Nope. This was Younger. More acidic and lacking the smooth richness and piney, sticky aftertaste, and gone was the once amazing nose of sap and sweet burnt sugar. With three to try on this visit, I had just one pour, and was, like my friend, stumped and disappointed. The vibe of visiting Windsor was pleasant, I took a self guided tour, the wait in the spring sunshine a mere three and a half hours, and the food there scrumptious. My friend and I shared a bottle of Refraction, a collab with Brooklyn Brewery, and that seemed to have more to offer. Still, I purchased two bottles of PtY to go to give it another shot at home.

Coconut Vibes - Barrel-Aged,,Illinois,4.73/5,"pours thick black with little coconut “floaties” resting on top. looks like it was bottled still. almost no carbonation. i do not pick up a lot of barrel on the nose, which i’ve become accustomed to doing on Side Project / Shared barrel-aged stouts. it must be the barrel though that makes the coconut aromas seem subdued when compared to batch 2 of the non barrel-aged version. taste is where this beer really shines. not so two-dimensional as the non barrel-aged batches, which are straight chocolate and coconut. this beer has that going on plus oak, whiskey on the back end and a little bit of vanilla. the barrel seems to cut the sweetness too. do not taste any of the 15% ABV this beer carries. important to note too that all the flavors taste very natural. to me, there is nothing worse than artificial coconut flavor in stouts / porters / beer. feel is thick as usual, although batch 2 of the non barrel aged version is thicker. again, little to no carbonation. overall, a fantastic barrel-aged stout. for being billed as a coconut stout this has so much more going on than just coconut. proof that you don’t have to overload a stout with additives to get a complex melding of flavors. sometimes less is more. although i think the Shared stouts are good enough without any barrel treatment, it is a great treat to get to try the barrel-aged versions and interesting to see how the barrel-aging changes or affects these beers. glad to have tried this.","Feb 10, 2019"

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,New York,4.81/5,"2021 batch.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells very strongly of coconut, with loads of milk and dark chocolate, very slight roast, light bourbon, and lots of creamy vanilla.

This is definitely sweet, but honestly, not as sweet as I expected. This really does meet the hype that it garners - it's exactly what you want out of high quality pastry. The coconut is done so well, it's so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty. There's a little bit of barrel, it helps anchor the beer slightly. The vanilla is also done very well, and it's all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer.

This is very creamy and rich, with no real booziness to it at all. It's very, very drinkable.

I almost didn't want this one to be good - I don't always like Angry Chair and this is such a hyped beer. Fortunately (unfortunately?) for me, it's honestly awesome. This is the best Angry Chair beer that I've ever had.","Jul 20, 2021"

Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own.

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Wisconsin,4.96/5,"2020 vintage:

Jet black, low head retention but a stubborn ring of lacing. Huge coconut and chocolate on the nose. The taste is really unbelievable, as far as staying true to the title. I've been told by several this is the best vintage yet, and I can understand why. Pastry stouts are already somewhat gimmicky by nature, but this one delivers the adjuncts in a way that is somehow both aggressive and balanced. It finishes thick, smooth and lingers for a while. This is a real treat, and delivers on the hype in a way that I rarely see. Drink fresh.","Mar 18, 2020"
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Germany,3.85/5,"Pours an oily, night black color with a small beige head, receeding immediately to a small ring of lacing.

Smells of toasted coconut, spicy licorice and warm oak. The nose isn‘t too pungent in itself with just a hint of vanilla hovering atop.

Drinks utmost thick, oily with a decadent, smooth mouthfeel. The body on this is huge, heavy and complex. 

Tastes of sweet milk chocolate, together with toasted, sweet coconut and a lighter, spicy, warming barrel appearance. Has an almost extreme oiliness to it, quite possibly from the prominent, flowery coconut in this, resulting into a decadent smoothness with loads of whipped cream. Finishes with even more chocolate covered spices, heavier on the licorice than on the barrel, leaving a longer lasting milk chocolate and licorice aftertaste on the palate.

Yepp, this is sweet and decadent. Its standout aspect is its supersmooth, silk mouthfeel, highlighting unfortunately nothing in particular. The coconut is well integrated in this, while the bourbon barrel only plays a minor part, wasting a lot of potential to overcome the simple number of adjuncts in this, potentially creating a truly complex stout.","Dec 30, 2019"

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Oregon,4.45/5,"Those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my reviews know that I carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stouts because I don’t handle sweetness very well. Some of you may have also noticed that I don’t seem as disenchanted when it comes to barrel-aged stouts and barleywine, when they sometimes taste as sweet, if not sweeter than other representations of pastry stouts available on the market.

Besides the actually unendurable levels of sweetness that set light up my TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 with the force of hellfire, the thing that puts me off most about pastry stouts seem to be the driving force behind its popularity. I’m not going to straight up say that I don’t like pastry stouts because of all the hype and attention they receive, because I myself am guilty of buying into beers and brands that receive hype and attention and actually enjoying them every once in a while, but it’s probably because one of the things I value most about beer is that it’s proletariat and ubiquitous in nature; if I like a beer, I want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one, or run to the store and buy another without feeling like I could have done better things with my money—the reason why I value mouthfeel so much in a beer is because I personally believe that correlates most strongly into how repeatable a beer is no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be, I normally won’t want to try another unless there’s some sense of balance or leveling factor that clears my palate for the next sip.

Given my totally made-up standards and personal values stated above, pastry stouts couldn’t stand any further from brews that I would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for. I’m pretty sure this comment will come back to bite me in the ass when I find myself standing in line for BA Double Stack next month, but I digress.

Some (actual) preliminary thoughts about this beer. Apparently German Chocolate Cake doesn’t really come from Germany, and despite its name, its main highlight is whipped cream and the coconut-pecan frosting that’s used to fill the cake. On a more relevant note, this beer is best summed up by contrasting it to the beloved Street Fighter ZERO character Hibiki Dan.

So for those of you that aren’t millennials or were living under a rock when Street Fighter, Dan’s character was created as a parody of SNK’s King of Fighters franchise characters Ryo and Robert, who very suspiciously resembled Street Fighter’s two most recognizable characters, Ryu and Ken. Outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two SNK characters that were ripping off Capcom characters that he was ripping off, Dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever; his super/EX combo finish, Shinkū Gadōken, for example, looks awfully similar to Ryū’s Shinkū Hadōken while doing 1/40th of the damage it does—many-a-times have I sat in front of the TV screen, thinking “oh shit I’m fucked” when I saw the screen suddenly turn red, orange, and yellow while CPU Dan caught me off guard with my HP at 30%, only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo.

Labored metaphors aside, BAIGCC is similar to Dan’s super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous, sugar-spice-and-everything-nice upside your head, but then presenting a rapidly drying finish, which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impact—it’s hard to explain in close detail, but it’s like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctor’s, where you don’t feel the needle going in, but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
A vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconuts, wild sugar cane, rum cake, baker’s chocolate, intense caramelized sugar hits you square in the noggin, followed by a frosting-like sweetness. There’s a slight hint of hazelnuts that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavors just simply drop off the side of the earth. Save for some residual flavors of hazelnuts and powdered sugar, your pixelated character brushes off the blow as if nothing happened and gets up ready to fight again—the fight against the glass is one of attrition after that initial “surprise”
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
The mouthfeel is initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter, but it morphs into a more tolerable moist-ish soft texture with subsequent sips. The only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer is if it were effervescent to the level of a brut champagne; the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteracts against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue.","May 12, 2019"
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Illinois,4.99/5,"Dark black with a pretty thin tan head. Smell is pure vanilla and coconut. Taste is out of this world, one of the best things I've ever tasted, period. Coconut up front, smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like German chocolate cake. The only knock I'll give it is that the barrel doesn't come through a ton in the flavor, but it's hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good. Pretty sweet, but not painfully so. Smooth feel, maybe I'd like it a little bit thicker, but again - this is just quibbling and it's hard to really knock this at all. Fantastic.","Apr 23, 2019"

A: Pours jet black with a thick cap of dark brown, espresso-like head. Recedes quickly to a sharp ring. A few dots of lacing.

S: Dark cocoa, toasted coconut, oak, vanilla bean ice cream, and bourbon, with light roast and anise rounding things out. Very well balanced between the various aromas. 

T: Rich liquid chocolate, moderate roast, toasted coconut, oak, bourbon, cola, and vanilla bean. Moderately sweet, like the base, but balanced more than the base with the bourbon and roast. 

M: Thick, chewy, and full bodied with medium carbonation. 

O: Exceptional BA pastry stout. Pretty sweet, as expected, but the sweetness is balanced with the other elements, all of which you can pick out individually.","Mar 09, 2019"
Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Minnesota,4.25/5,"Thanks to Heisenbrew for this 750ML bottle, which I am taking solo tonight. If you don’t hear from me by Sunday night, please send someone out to check my dead body’s blood sugar level. 

Ever go blind? That’s how dark the beer is, with nearly no visible carbonation. The nose is barrel aged brownie whipped up with bitter cocoa. I’d eat that. 

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake – Barrel Aged was easily my favorite beer from Tampa Beer Week 2018, & the bottle doesn’t quite live up to my glowing memories. It is, of course, sweet enough that my vulnerability to type 2 diabetes just ticked upwards 5%. Straight corn syrup mixes with cane sugar & supremely bitter chocolate to form the base: the chocolate actually took a half hour to warm before the nasty edge wore off the bitter cocoa. Below the sweet upper crust is a healthy helping of bourbon, milky chocolate, long pull of vanilla, & cake batter. I don’t believe I typed that. Thick, full, coma-inducing. Pretty sure I’m not going to have any trouble finishing this off by myself. That said, I’m getting full. 

Not as mid-blowing as fresh off the tap, but still an excellent beer…if you have a high tolerance for all things sugar.","Mar 01, 2019"

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Minnesota,4.5/5,"I've nearly managed to try Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake stout on two or three occasions now - this time, it did not elude me! I also had the pleasure of trying this side by side with the non-barrel-aged bottle - and while this experience certainly hurt my teeth a bit, it was a pretty great time to be alive!

I've had my fair share of sweet, sticky, dessert beverages, but there's just something about Angry Chair's dessert stouts that surpasses everyone else's attempts - the beers are practically simple syrup in consistency and taste, but then they're also quite high in ABV, and don't taste it for a second. BAIGCCS is like a bucket of fudgy chocolate cake batter goodness - it coats your glass and it's absolutely opaque. The carb is so minimal that it's like drinking a light viscosity glass of motor oil. A delicious one, obviously. The nose is rich and warm, and that chocolate is just excellent on the nose and in the taste buds.

I really liked this beer - but as I told my friends, I think this will be the only time I'll ever drink it, and I'm honestly pretty okay with that. It's just too much - there's no moderation to this beer. It's a bottle that you essentially need to share, because the flavors and syrupyness of the beer is just unrelenting.

In all, like many of Angry Chair's beers, it's a tremendously compelling novelty - I really enjoy, and would certainly recommend it... but I can happily live without it ever again. Yum and done, basically.","Aug 06, 2018"

Fundamental Observation,,Michigan,4.68/5,"Received from a generous person in a NBS BIF back in 2020 and split with a friend soon thereafter. This is from the notes.
Pours the color of strong coffee (""Stout Black"" I like to call it) and is light blocking dark in the glass with just a little walnut hue on the edges. The deep brown head is inviting and slow to dissipate.
The aroma gave me vanilla first, bourbon second, and the menagerie of dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, wood, char that make up the malts contribution to the smells. Very nice, if a little more vanilla than expected.
The taste was solid. The vanilla, so heavily featured in the aroma, was first on the tongue, followed and overwhelmed my the coffee-chocolate-dark fruits almost cake like in effect; not sweet exactly, just decadent (if that makes any sense) The bourbon was in the swallow, terminating the pastry party effectively.
The feel was a viscous pleasure. For such an ABV I like something with heft, or body - to sip and savor, not quaff down like some AAL. This nicely fits my preferences almost perfectly.
Would love to try again, but glad I got to try it at least once.","Jun 28, 2023"
Fundamental Observation,,Australia,4.23/5,"Received from the ever-generous @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022, and drunk in May 2023. 

L: Thick, jet black. Utterly still. There's a thin coat of rusty, coppered-coloured foam atop the glass. 

S: Umami roastiness, booze, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, and ethereal spirit notes from the bourbon. Surprisingly, this didn't change much as the beer warmed. 

T: Vanilla and bourbon notes dominate the initial swallow, and then a wave of booze crashes over the top, burning throat, tongue and larynx like a good RIS should. There's a tangy hit of malt and then a retronasal whack of cookie dough settles in and lingers long. Warmth settles in the stomach and a medicinal sweetness slides in after the cookie dough fades. There's an excellent balance to this beer - there's no danger of cloying sweetness, nor is there so much stickiness that wasps begin to hover expectantly around my head. 

M: Mouthfeel is thick and unctuous - there's minimal carbonation but it suits the beer well. As noted above there's warmth seeping lazily through my body at the halfway mark of this one, and it settles deep and comfortably, like an old, familiar couch.

O: This is an enjoyable but intense beer experience. There's no likelihood of a second beer after you've spent an hour or so in the company of this beer, but the size of this beer means that's not a problem. 

Cheers!

Fundamental Observation,,New York,4.73/5,"Appearance: Fundamental Observation has a deep, dark brown color with a creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly. The beer is opaque and has good clarity.

Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, dark fruit (figs, raisins), and a hint of smokiness. There is also a distinct hop character that adds to the overall aroma profile.

Taste: The flavor is full-bodied and robust with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. The dark chocolate and coffee notes are prominent, with hints of dark fruit, toasted nuts, and smokiness. The hop character adds a pleasant bitterness to the finish.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a moderate carbonation that adds a nice effervescence. The beer is full-bodied and has a long finish that lingers on the tongue.

Overall impressions: Fundamental Observation is a well-crafted, complex beer with a rich flavor profile. The aroma and taste are well-balanced, and the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This beer is a great choice for those who enjoy dark, rich, and full-bodied stouts.","Oct 09, 2022"
Fundamental Observation,,Ohio,4.23/5,"I had both the 2018 and 2019 vintage. This review is for the 2019 vintage. The 2019 is not substantially different (going off memory), although I think the body (mouthfeel) is a little thicker.

Surprisingly, at 3 years this beer hasn't lost much (any?) vanilla, although refrigerated most of that time. 

The best part of this beer is either the taste or the smell. The nose is loaded with what reminds me of buttercream icing - with a hint of something else. Perhaps the alcohol that you get off vanilla extract. The taste is similar, but the buttercream on the taste is more of something you have to use your imagination for. It's the essence, but not direct flavor. Lots of deep, fudgy chocolate. A bit of alcohol on the back end, which is unusual, but I suspect is a result of the interaction with the vanilla. While tasty, I wouldn't say that the taste is complex.

Nothing exceptional about this beer, but it is very good. I think that my score accurately reflects how I feel about this beer and what I think it is deserving of.","Sep 24, 2022"
Fundamental Observation,,Connecticut,4.45/5,"Sampling a cellar temp bottle poured into my snifter. Received in part of my winnings for NFL BIF 33. This is a 2019 vintage with 13.55% ABV

Aroma is dark fudge, chocolate, bourbon, some vanilla notes and a little fusol alcohol. No hop presence on this aroma.
First sip is lighter body than I expected and smooth slightly creamy texture. Carbonation is soft and gentle and rolls easily across my palate. Easy drinking for a big boozy beer.
Flavor is sweet fudge and chocolate with hints of toffee and brown sugar. I also get bourbon and some vanilla and black peppery spicy heat on the finish. Again hops dont show up anywhere in this brew.

Fundamental Observation,,Michigan,4.79/5,"Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules.

A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly.

S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it. 

T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla. 

M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had.

O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this.

Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan.","May 06, 2022"
Fundamental Observation,,Washington,4.35/5,"The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention. This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous). On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice. It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish. Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit. Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range. 

This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find. Still a very solid beer...","Apr 18, 2022"

Nose of fig, big thread of booze, some barrel, dark rock candy, espresso grounds and a big vanilla hit.
Fig jam, pastel de nata-ish vanilla pastry tart, root beer, bourbon, ash - but also rum-soaked chocolate cake - but also a ton of booze-soaked dried fruit - with a clean, char-less, roast finish. 
Rich, full, chewy, round, dead smooth and NO BURN

4 4.5 4.75 4.5 4.5

Looks lethal and the nose goes as deep as you want it to. I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate…
That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.”
4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over. 
It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful. 


All the hype is true. 2010 Vanilla BCBS is the only thing that comes close. Fantastic.","Mar 04, 2022"

500ml bottle split between a pair of tulips. 2021 bottle, batch 007. Mine is labeled ""Imperial Vanilla Stout"" andthe label lists it as 14.0% abv. Received from @Beersnake1 in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #14.

Pours black, very thick, no head, no visible carbonation. Smell is sweet milk chocolate, alcohol, roasty/burnt bitterness.

Taste is sweet chocolatey, lots of booze, vanilla, oak. Strong roast bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, with a small amount of grittiness. Overall, very nice beer.","Dec 25, 2021"
Fundamental Observation,,Michigan,3.69/5,"Pours a pitch black. No translucency. A finger of mocha head arises and quickly reduces to a thin ring. Oily traces line the glass after each sip. Aroma is vanilla, coffee, chocolate, caramel and dark fruit. Taste follows suit, exactly. Feel is silky smooth. It is a good beer but very average for its overall rating on BA. I’ve had much better.","Dec 11, 2021"
Fundamental Observation,,Illinois,4.63/5,"Pours pitch black, completely opaque and shiny. It appears thick and viscous. Thin, weakish, velvety mocha colored head fleetingly appears on the beer. 

The aroma has notes of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, caramelized brown sugar, brownie batter, oak, and some light smoke and dark fruit notes. The vanilla however is the show here - its absolutely dominated by the vanilla and its lovely.

Taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, sweet cream, bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, chocolate and yea, vanilla. If you like your vanilla stout to avoid subtly this is perfect. Its sweet, but dances up to the cloying line without going over. The barrel aging is nicely balanced. There is a light smokiness that I occasionally get, but I suspect that is the influence of the bourbon. 

Feel is thick, fuller bodied, smooth and viscous. Mild, soft carbonation, but it does not come across as under carbonated.

Overall this is absolutely delicious - an absolutely outstanding use of vanilla in a barrel aged stout.","Nov 20, 2021"

Fundamental Observation,,New York,5/5,"2018 bottle Poured cold, hard to a tulip. Jet black, no floaters. No head at all…starts to bubble for a ring, then peters out. Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage. As it warms, that might change. I can see why people search this out. Excellent brew!","Jul 30, 2021"

Very Hazy,,Pennsylvania,4.71/5,"Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in December 2022. There was a canned date of 7/8/22 @ 06:18:22 on the bottom of the can with a label ""WEEKEND BEER"". I bought this at the brewery, and drank about 2 months from purchase.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a large amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.6% listed on the can.

Smell: Papaya, nectarine and passionfruit; somewhat dank and green

Taste: The dank, green tones propel to the front, with the tropical elements building underneath, bringing papaya and passionfruit; nectarine flavors emerge to bring sweet stone fruit, after the swallow; moderately bitter in the finish

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate to high carbonation

""Long days and pleasant nights"" on the date code

Lovely look as per usual. Glowing gold, hazy, ok covering of creamy white head that leaves swooping lacing. The aroma is dank and earthy compared to what I was expecting, with some stonefruit and clementine sweetness underneath. Perhaps a tiny bit faded, but I might be having an off day. Delicious and enticing regardless. The flavor is (as expected) a barrage of peaches, citrus (sweet not tart or bitter) and weedy hop funk. There is definitely more to it but on the whole it is a balance between peachy sweetness, canteloup, clementine and the more resinous (but not sappy) character of the hops. Mouthfeel is spot on as usual, creamy, round and filling while also refreshing. Really nice beer. I think it was Haze that I once described as a sweaty hippie taking a nap in the shade after a day of harvesting peaches. Well in this case the hippie is also burning one and we are smelling his feet after stomping up some overripe peaches to make wine. Or something like that I have no idea...

Very Hazy,,Colorado,4.17/5,"really cool to get to drink this, so thankful i have people in my life who want to share this kind of thing with me, but i am just shocked that this comes in at number 15 on the BA top beers list, like in the entire world, seems outlandish for something i would not even describe as insanely well refined or anything, and yeah the hop profile is great, but it also has some burn, some unneeded weight, feels under carbonated to me, and really doesnt distinguish itself as elite in any way. that might sound harsh, if this was from my local watering hole i would be pretty stoked, but to get all in a tizzy about it is simply foolish, which is not true of all the tree house hyped hazy ones by the way, but is true about this one. super dense looking from the 12 ounce can, high frothy white headed and all, but dull a little bit and chewy, not as maybe well refined as expected or as very green was pretty much right next to it. i wish they told you the hops, but then i guess everyone would copycat it, but it seems somewhat conventional, like citra could be driving it along with something just slightly spicy at this dosage, a bit of bitterness which i dont hate, short of green burn, a fine line in this style and they walk it, but i am perhaps seeking a little more. it warms up favorably before the alcohol takes over, i get green pear, orange tic tac candy, and a little white grape, its tasty, even downright awesome, and i like the way it kind of permeates the tongue and hangs after each swallow, its semi permanent on the palate. not oily or slick feeling through, truly a new england type to its core. minimal grain flavor but all the body in the world, nobody would call this balance, and i dont need it to be, but it seems big for the sake of it, like the hops dont even want this much structure, and not that its forced, but just that its not perfect, as the ratings seem to suggest. i like their yeast and its used well here, its a little short on bubbles for a big one, at least for my preferences, and overall the flavor cannot be denied, this is yummy, but is it objectively amazing beer leagues better than the rest in this space? heck no. one of the more anticipated but least epic tree house beers ive cut into, which is still to say its still excellent, but it certainly has a peer group...","Jul 14, 2022"

The taste is more on the passionfruit side, with creamed orange and strawberry again. Very strong hop burn creates some twiggy / cardboard-like character and bitterness on the backend.

Relatively full bodied and silky feeling with tight carbonation.

The hop burn is a bit too much here for my taste, but otherwise a far better than average beverage. I’m sure when it hits its sweet spot it’s magical. Just a bit acerbic in the aftertaste to me.","May 16, 2022"

Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of slightly off-white rests atop a murky golden body. The aroma is moderate but delivers some resin, tropical and citrusy fruits, and a touch of pine. The taste is loaded with hop resins and acids giving it a bite. I'm finding flavors of passionfruit, papaya, mango, orange, and peach. It's interesting how different this is from ""Hazy"" given that it's got the same hops, just more of them, and a minimal amount of extra alcohol. That hop bite really changes how the sweetness of the malt bumps up the flavors of the hops. Wow, they really are two totally different beers - this one is far more aggressive and resinous while the ""Hazy"" is softer and sweeter. This seems to have more bitterness as well but that could just be the extra acidity from hops. It's mainly dry from start to finish, but it's DEFINITELY dry in the finish once those acids have built up on you. I can even feel my lips burning. That changes the mouth feel a little bit from the ""Hazy"", but it's still medium bodied wtih a whole lot of extra proteins that makes it feel a little fuller. It's not as smooth as the hazy though because of that acid. Some light orange, citrus pith, and resins linger. I appreciate the greater intensity here but for my money I'll go for the softer and sweeter ""Hazy"".

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,Texas,4/5,"16.9oz bottled best by 9-7-24, opened 9-10-23.
Thin tan head with limited staying power, falls to a ring and island quickly and hangs there. Opaque body at the core with dark brown at the edge. No lace.
Rich, roasty malt aroma with dark fruit, earthy coffee, wet wood, and spice.
Lots of fruit flavors, unclear if it's a by-product of the coffee or yeast, malt, booze, or some other component. Coffee shows best after 30 minutes or so of warming up. Booze is present but almost an afterthought amidst the cacaphony of fruit and coffee flavors.
Medium plus body with some prickly heat. Smoother mouthfeel as it warms. Lengthy, flavorful finish with a bit of sweetness.

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,Rwanda,4.84/5,"This is the 2022 vintage with Burundian Turihamwe coffee blend from Intelligentsia. Poured from the 16.9 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. 

Look: The beer is a pure opaque black with no light coming through. Topped with a creamy finger thick head with OK retention. This is a real imperial looking stout.

Smell: Creamy aroma of mocha and fresh espresso. Deep chocolate notes throughout. Not as much bourbon as in the original variant on first glance, which may be a good thing. This is inviting. Dark fruits somewhere within. As the beer warms, more of the bourbon and woody noes come out a bit. Vanilla makes an appearance as well as this warms, and a slight spice.

Taste: Chocolatey up front with notes of mocha in between roasted and toasted malt. Some vanilla quickly covered up by bourbon, which is immediately more evident than in the aroma. Brown sugar, creme caramel. Surprising that this beer retains a sweeter than expected character throughout. Finishes with just as touch of bourbon underneath a really smooth, almost fruity and spicy coffee note. Again not as heavy handed with the bourbon, which is definitely there, but much more nuanced.

Feel: Creamy with light carbonation. Coating. Finishes smooth with just a hint of tingling alcohol at the very end.

Overall: Oh yeah, this is a good one. I love that it doesn't try to hammer you over the head with the bourbon flavor. Instead it slowly brings you in with a wide variety of flavors. The spotlight here is the Turihamwe coffee blend, which really makes a difference in the flavor profile that shows in the end product. A premium product for sure, but it lives up to expectations, revealing something new at every sip. A special experience that will probably show up in my top 10.","Jul 08, 2023"

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,Texas,4.47/5,"2022 vintage brewed with Intelligentsia Turihamwe poured from a bottle into a snifter
13.2 % abv.
Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with a small head of tan colored foam. Upon pouring the brew it looks thick, slowly glugging from the glass. Swirling the beer in the snifter further reveals its thickness, showing sticky fingers of beer clinging to the sides of the vessel. The brown head fades away moderately quickly leaving bits of sticky looking fingers of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The nose is very big and sweet with lots of molasses, brown sugar, and caramel. At the same time there is a big dark presence to the nose with coffee, char, and a big dose of roasted and toasted malt. Adding to the coffee comes a very strong spent coffee grain like smell as well as some almost sweeter carob smells. A bit of dark chocolate and some plum and fig are there as well, adding more sweet and dark to the nose. A decent showing of bourbon and oak are there as well, mixing with some smells of leather and smoke, with the total mix producing a dark and sweet, coffee heavy, aroma overall.
Taste – The taste begins with a very thick and heavy sweet and roasted flavor. The sweet is a mix of molasses and brown sugar with the roasted flavors being a mix of slightly charred malt and a good hit of coffee. The coffee seems to get stronger and stronger as the taste advances being joined by some dark fruit flavors of raisin and prune. At the same time the roasted malt diminishes a touch, but is replaced by more char and leather and a touch of crème. Some vanilla and cocoa that were present upfront, fade more toward the end of the taste profile, being replaced by some warming bourbon and woody tastes. A touch of smoke joins in at the end, and with the bourbon, coffee, roast and sweet one is left with a very robust, dark, and warming taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is quite thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is low. Fantastic for the style and the big abv. of the brew making a very nice slow sipper.
Overall – A very well-crafted brew. A bit sweeter then former versions I have had, but still overall very drinkable and flavorful. A nice warmer for sure and one to seek after.","Feb 27, 2023"

Caramel & vanilla note meld with coffee as this beer warms up, a little dark chocolate as well. Sweetness dominates the finish more than coffee, which is okay by me, a trace of barrel & dryness on the edges

MF: Medium body, restrained carbonation, warming 

Glad I got to try this variant, I liked, can't say that I love it. I certainly wanted it more barrel-forward. This almost makes me think of Vietnamese Coffee, except for a little boozeyness","Feb 19, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,Ohio,4.62/5,I am trying the 2022 bottle of this beer at my good friend and old neighbor 's house whilst passing through on our way to see my daughter compete against UW Eau Claire in Gymnastics. It poured an opaque dark with khaki ring head and did not leave any lace. The scent had beautiful arabica coffee notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to sip.

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,Texas,4.28/5,"Appearance: Black glass shows ruby clarity with strong back light, no head.

Aroma: Molasses, bourbon barrel, deep rich malt. Some firm alcohol vapors as it warms.

Taste: Super malty without being super sweet, which is a nice trick. Pretty one dimensional, not much nuance. Don't get any real coffee flavor, flashes of a citric hop note which are nice. 

Mouthfeel: Heavy body, light chew, very low carbonation, viscous, mouth coating, lip smacking finish which is fairly clean.

Overall: A well made beer, tasty, pretty each drinking for the heft, but the cost ($26 for the 1 pint 9 oz. bottle) doesn't really match the experience. I'm willing to bet they spent serious money on making it, so I don't feel ripped off, but I can't see buying another.","Jan 22, 2023"

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Bottled 9/11/22. Pours jet black with no leakage anywhere - it is a black brick in the glass - and a substantial, creamy mocha colored head that sticks around, then provides a nice cap as you drink the beer. A gorgeous imperial stout.

The nose is led by a sledgehammer of roasty coffee aromas, some chocolate, a nice little stone fruit note, and some barrel notes.

The taste is led by the roasty coffee, which is absolutely delicious, and there’s some chocolate (which works well), and a bit of barrel heat, but what makes this beer for me is the significant stone fruit flavor, which provides balance to the roasty coffee flavor and really enhances the experience and enjoyment of this beer.

The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied, not watery as some other bottle dates have been reported. As a total non-coffee drinker, but a beer nerd who LOVES big imperial coffee stouts, this is world class, IMHO.","Dec 30, 2022"

Now this is a special one, the highest rated English Barleywine on BA, VSOJ! A long time want of mine, I wanted to try it while I have the Double Barrel VSOJ on the way thanks to Tavour. I’ve had the OG Straight Jacket and some variants before, but this is by far the most exciting. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

The nose brings an intense wave of sweetness, but it’s balanced out by spicier notes. I’m picking up on aromas of burnt caramel, sweet whiskey, molasses, rye bread, golden raisin, brown sugar, charred oak, old leather, fig, tobacco, and sweet toffee

Wow, everything in taste is kicked up a notch, boozy and fruity but not overly sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting fig, sweet toffee, burnt caramel, black cherry, molasses, dry oak, vanilla, earthy whiskey, and light brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of sweet whiskey, charred oak, molasses, rye bread, tobacco, raisin, brown sugar, burnt caramel, vanilla, old leather, and light toffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky and boozy, yet still drinks well below the listed 15%

Oh yeah, this is one hell of a beer. As expected from Revolution, it’s so much thinner in execution in relation to the flavor. I can’t wait to try the Double Barrel VSOJ next","Feb 06, 2023"
V.S.O.J.,,Pennsylvania,4.8/5,"Oh damn this absolutely lives up to its reputation. Nothing unfamiliar in a barleywine here but there is a lot going on and everything is so BIG. 2-4 years in barrels adds such a layer of... profundity to the already stellar Straight Jacket. I feel underdressed, semi-literate, and unwashed sipping on this.

Raisins, molasses, high end whiskey, and leather dominate. There is a lot more at the edges though, candied nuts, honey, pipe tobacco, and a hell of a lot more. Such enveloping, deep warmth but not at all hot. People with access to Revolution are lucky indeed. Thanks so much FBarber!","Oct 23, 2022"
V.S.O.J.,,Idaho,4.26/5,"12oz can at share. Dark brown pour with a foamy beige head. Aroma is malty, toffee, prunes, , hint of vanilla.

Malty and caramelly flavor with chocolate and raisin leading into a vanilla and bourbon finish. Had side by side with Straight Jacket and this one definitely smelled and tasted more chocolatey and caramelly; more decadent. World class BW.","Sep 28, 2022"
V.S.O.J.,,Indiana,4.71/5,"Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.

The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).

The mouthfeel is creamy and more than a bit oily, as expected. I sat on this a bit, and it was more than worth the wait. Truly a world class English barleywine.","Sep 04, 2022"
V.S.O.J.,,Missouri,4.7/5,"Pours a dark burgundy that reveals a remarkably clear transparency when held directly against a light. If not held against a light, or if poured in a dark room, the beer looks black. Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam.

Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms.

Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts. 

Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol. 

Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice. 

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV. 

For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish.

Served neat in a Glencairn glass.","Apr 23, 2022"

It boasts a great Barleywine smell with toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, tobacco smoke, oak, and subtle but discernible bourbon. The taste is ridiculous! It's particularly fruity with lots of raisin, plum, and fig, along with loads of brown sugar and toffee, oaky char, tobacco, and a strong, hot bourbon presence. There is little bitterness. The tastes really pop; it's incredibly flavorful. Its mouthfeel is rich and creamy with appropriate and pleasant carbonation, and there's no escaping the 15% ABV; you can feel the alcohol burn.

The aroma was bourbon and malts, taste is almost sweet but isn’t, not sure how that happens. Figs, raisins, plums all swirling in the bourbon.
The taste rather follows, just more intense, amazing flavors and the 15% ABV is well hidden. Really, really good.

Smell - The nose was sweet. Notes of caramel and earthy malts came before the booze. 

Taste - Oh my! Caramel lead the way, followed by leather and mild bourbon. The booze was so perfectly balanced that it took nothing away from the base beer. This is an example of a beer that slept well in barrels. The profile was modestly warming but certainly did not burn.

More molasses, anise, booze, and brown sugar at the end with a sticky, lingering finish. Body is full with low carbonation. Rich and oily on the palate and goes down smooth, rich, and hot.

Aroma is a tad overwhelmed by the high ABV, as I’m finding it difficult to find complex characteristics through the alcohol burn. Pull the glass away a bit, and you can pick up aromas of sweet, caramel malts, coconut and vanilla truffles.

After the first sip, I understand the reputation. It’s so incredibly balanced, with flavors dominated by oak-derived coconut, old leather, booze soaked raisins and creme brûlée. This base beer was brewed for barrel-aging. It spent years expanding and contracting into the American oak staves, wading through the spirits that previously resided there. It lets the barrel shine, but maintains its own identity. Finishes with mouth-numbing alcohol, but the slick coconut flavors last for minutes after. It’s absolutely epic, and outside of 2016 Whiskey A Deal with the Devil, it’s the best barleywine I’ve ever had. Unreal.","Jul 26, 2021"

Oude Fermier,,Illinois,4.68/5,"2020 vintage. Mostly clear yellow pour with a fat finger of eggshell white foam, spotted lacing. I went in skeptical here, but actually I must admit this is top shelf! Smell capture a myriad of oak nuances catching fruit: peach, orange, lime, white grape, and green apple as the most defined, add a hint of dandelion and must to round out. Taste takes it a step further: honestly SP's best non-fruit wild saison, if not their best saison period. Add passion fruit, pear, and a whisper of grapefruit to the fruit from the nose, oak is now toasty and bright, vinous kiss adds layers in a gentle way, floral tones are more generic compared to nose though, must and funk elevate. Feel is bright, sour, sneaky funky, oak backing is refined, and dries out well through the sip with controlled acidity dotting the palate, very dialed in.","May 15, 2023"

This one pours a golden, slightly hazy yellw color, with a small white head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like white wine, lemon candy, leathery funk, lime, stone fruit, white grape must, grassy funk, and Smarties.

This is absolutely outstanding stuff, perhaps the best wild ale that I've had from Side Project. It's immensely complex, with some light sweetness, almost candied dried fruit like, with lemon, lime, peach, grape must, a sort of leathery and grassy intense funk, and lots of wine barrel.

This is light bodied, effervescent, and super drinkable, with a very manageable acidity. It's softly carbonated.

Oude Fermier,,Indiana,5/5,"A- Pours a brilliant and somewhat turbid golden hue, this beer hits the glass with a frothy, pillowy head forming very quickly. The head retention is tremendous as it sits upon orange-golden beer. Lacing is also very good and overall, this beer looks amazing in the glass.

S- The first scent that hits the nose is Cory's signature, lightly tart Fermier profile. It is citrus forward, delicate, and just a little bit sour without being overt in any direction. Lots of apple and a bit of semi-dry white wine characteristics mix in as well. The back of the scent is a little drier and more oak forward, with the white wine flavors taking a bit of a back seat.

T- As soon as this beer hits the tongue, flashes of Saison du Fermier flash through my memory.The beginning of the drink is fruit forward, showing off the apples and light chardonnay characteristics from the scent. A bit of tartness ramps up just a touch before a dose of citrus (mostly orange forward) hits the tongue. As the second half of the drink washes over the tongue, the yeast adds some balance to the beer with a drying and oak forward flavor contribution. Just the slightest bit of funk hits, then the white wine acidity and light fruit profile returns as the drink washed off the tongue and down the throat. The lingering flavor is mostly white wine and oak, with a moderate dose of apples still hanging around.

M- Like most Side Project saisons, fluffy is the best word I can think of to describe their feel in the mouth. Light and soft while being easy to drink, this beer once again strikes a nearly perfect balance between feel and flavor. The alcohol isn't noticeable in the feel, yet this feels dangerously quaffable.

Overall, this special version of Saison du Fermier is a damn near perfect beer. It is tart, complex, balance, and dry and truly drinks like a fine white wine. The feel matches the flavor perfectly and the flavors throughout the drink compliment each other st every turn. I wish I had more of this beer, but damn am I glad to have had one bottle to enjoy.","Sep 04, 2016"

A: mandarin orange yellow with a nice off white head.

Oak also present.

M: like riding on a Nimbus cloud! So pillowy and dry. Just lasts for days!

Oude Fermier,,New Jersey,5/5,"This is one of the one best beers I have ever had. I didn't think it was possible to improve on Saison du Fermier, but Side Project did it with this barrel-aged version. This is really something special.","Feb 21, 2015"
Oude Fermier,,Missouri,4.92/5,"Poured into a Side Project stem and shared amongst a few guys

A - Similar to Saison Du ferm, tough to tell with how dark it was outside but with a light shining through it, it resembled Du Ferm with a 2 finger white frothy foam head. 

S - Smell was fantastic, loads of wine character coming through on this with slight notes of tart, there was a sweetness on the nose that made this better smelling than saison du fernier. Funky nose. 

T - Taste was very unique, the front started as does Saison Du Ferm. Slight acidity, but a lot for a saison, this is followed by lemony citrus notes. The finish is what sets this beer apart from other SP. Extremely complex sweet yet funky finish with loads of bright citrus notes. I don't get any of the hay-esque notes that I do out of Du Ferm. This is soo smooth.

M - Mouthfeel is spot on here. Creamy, smooth, relatively full for a saison and it just goes down with ease. The taste lingers for a while.

O - This is my Favorite SP behind Black and Wild. Fuzzy is close, especially for how good it is drinking right now, but this was amazing, definitely in the top 10 overall beers for me","Sep 05, 2014"
Oude Fermier,,Missouri,4.85/5,"Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass.

Pours similar to regular Fermier. A nice hazy golden bright yellow with some mild orange hues and a nice lively white head. 

Aroma is fuuuuunky. Way more funk and wood than the base beer. Notes of mild lemon and some slight acidity are present in the nose. Hay, moldy wood and well just plain oldness.

Flavor follows the nose well. Sharp acidity starts things off with some nice notes of lemon and citric acid. Vinous character of white wine grape skins with some nice dry tannins. Bready and earthy grain character can be perceived in the back with soft notes of woody oak. Very nice balance between funk and tartness. Saison du Fermier is one of my fave SP beers and this variant does it justice. It might not be as approachable but the experience palette will love this.","Aug 16, 2014"

nose is layered with depth. from sweet tarts to white wine vibrant oak. very fresh and full of life. funky and sour fruit.

very similar to nose with more emphasis on sourness. wine comes out a tad more

soft and mellow with the right amount of bite to compliment the sourness.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,New York,4.91/5,"Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak-Aged Barleywine is an extraordinary beer that left a lasting impression on my taste buds. The combination of its rich double oak aging and complex flavors creates a truly remarkable experience. The aroma greets you with notes of caramel, vanilla, and subtle hints of bourbon, setting the stage for what’s to come.

The taste is where this beer truly shines. The double oak aging process imparts a smoothness that is both velvety and warming. It boasts a perfect balance of malty sweetness, dark fruit flavors, and a delicate touch of oak and bourbon. As it warms up, the complexities further unfold, revealing layers of complexity that keep you intrigued throughout each sip.

The mouthfeel is luxurious and full-bodied, showcasing the craftsmanship behind this beer. The finish is long-lasting, leaving a pleasant aftertaste that beckons you to take another sip.

While this is certainly not an everyday beer due to its higher ABV, it is undeniably a treat worth savoring on special occasions or for those seeking an indulgent experience. Its bold flavors and well-crafted profile make it a standout among barrel-aged beers.

Whether you’re an avid beer enthusiast or simply looking to try something exceptional, Anchorage Brewing’s A Deal with the Devil Double Oak is undoubtedly a top-tier choice that I highly recommend. Cheers!","Aug 06, 2023"

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,Massachusetts,4.26/5,"*Batch 5*

Pours the deepest of dark browns, no head. Bourbon and leather on the nose masking some almond and perhaps also some dried fruit. My partner says Twizzlers, and I can see that too. Under the omnipresence of bourbon, I get raisin, brown sugar, then cola and fig on the finish. This is good albeit a little sweet, which does make it hard to get to completion, if you are drinking this on its own, which if you spent a lot of money on the bottle, you are probably feeling this way. Anyway, it's a good beer and barleywine. I think the barrel character, the oak, could've been more rugged, but it has plenty of boozy character.","May 11, 2023"
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,California,4.7/5,"Pours a rich mahogany with red edges. Head is reluctant, but slowly emerges with tight tan bubbles, almost like it’s nitro’d. 

Quiet nose, still dominated by alcohol heat, even after 6 years of aging. Pull your nose back from the glass, and you’re met with subtle vanilla, coconut and stewed dark fruits. 

Flavors are massive, and immediately hit you with boozy, oaky, tannic cognac bite. It evolves into dark caramel, toffee, bitter pecan, figs and vanilla. Just a huge barrel influence, with flawless blending to keep things in balanced. Sweetness is perfectly in check, and you’d never know it’s 17%. 

Mouthfeel is impossibly smooth with absolutely no alcohol burn. It’s perfect. 

Perfect birthday beer. Exactly the type of thing I love. Huge barrel character, tempered sweetness, tons of oaky vanilla. This beer laughs at 6 years of aging.. it could last 60.","May 01, 2023"
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,Massachusetts,4.54/5,"2022 vintage

I've finally arrived at the illustrious A Deal With The Devil series. I have not had the base beer, but I recently came across this and the Triple Oak-Aged version. Considering this is review #1599 for me, I wonder what I'll choose for the milestone review #1600...Let's get into it

Pours a cloudy dark brown with just a finger of tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing, but with fantastic legs

The nose here is very sweet, but in no way overbearing, with much of the sweetness coming from dark fruit notes. I’m picking up on aromas of fig, dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, vanilla, black cherry, burnt caramel, charred oak, cognac, molasses, light port wine, and toasted walnut

It keeps up the sweetness and the balance of said sweetness in taste despite some seriously boozy notes that come through, and somehow improves upon it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet bourbon, brown sugar, raisin, toasted oak, vanilla, smoky tobacco, sticky caramel, light coconut, plum, and a touch of port wine. The swallow brings notes of black cherry, plum, port wine, burnt caramel, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, charred oak, earthy bourbon, walnut, and the slightest hint of fusel alcohol

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a slick and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry and seriously complex, and the booze actually works really well here for a perfect mouthfeel

This is awesome. I'm not sure it's worth what it sells for, but who cares? It was great to get to try this nonetheless. With the second highest rated American Barleywine behind me, we all know what's next","Apr 07, 2023"
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,Illinois,4.3/5,"This was supposed to be a legendary Barley wine. It was also a very expensive barley wine. Maybe my palate is not developed enough to tell the difference between this and other BA barley wine's.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,California,4.29/5,"2022 bottle. Poured at fridge temp. Pours a crazy dark brown - almost black. A VERY thin layer of light brown head, but it's pretty much non-existent. Going into this one, I figured it would be boozy and intense, given the ABV. Let's find out. The nose is a BA barleywine on steroids. Holy crap. Super intense notes of Armagnac, brown sugar, bourbon-soaked toffee, figs, plums, raisins, tons of vanilla, and a hint of coconut. Dang this is a beast! After a couple of minutes of sipping on this, the bourbon barrel really shines through even more. At this ABV, I can almost transport myself to sniffing a Glencairn with Woodford bourbon in it. If you like bourbon, this is a barleywine for you!

The taste is equally as intense, but not as balanced as the nose. Here the sharp bitterness kicks in, along with a strong sweetness. They are fighting for top spot. I think it's simply that the bourbon is so incredibly strong in this one that it overpowers the barleywine taste. Still, really nice notes of toffee, plums, raisins, vanilla, oak, clove, pine needles, mint, leather, slight coffee grounds, chocolate, molasses, and an earthy note. Even after a little while, it's still incredibly boozy. What's odd is that I love bourbon and I love barleywine, but they fight in an odd way in this one. Don't get me wrong, it's great, but it could have been a lot better (IMO) with a lower ABV. 

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the aftertaste is mostly toffee, booze, and an earthy/hoppy note. Overall, this is a good one, but loses some points for being slightly out of balance.","Jan 21, 2023"

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,New Jersey,4.35/5,"A: The intensity behind the chemical build: C₂H₅OH, offers a nuanced portrayal to rivulets. To that end, an awareness that speaks to the tears of wine, when temperature facilities an elongated structure. Inversely, a transitory adherence on suds, as the collar rebuffs retention in a hotfoot manner. The initial hue on the neck is a desert sand reflection, while the collapsed rim offers a wooded brown tinge. Just underneath, a body that’s been discharged to a raisin black wash with Charleston Green pathways, as the emissions transcript a tone near Byzantium. The output is short on ebullition, and thick on opacity, due to a circumstantial impartiality

S: A strong timbered hop effect that’s confronted rigorously, by the concentrated malt profile, while the casks set a nearby perimeter. The directive is dense on implying a condensed coffee puck to the regions of Guatemala & Colombia, when connoting treacly dark fruits. Secondly, a path that touches on creamy Dark Roca, aside Turrón De Coco, while funding a piney provision. That provision is keen to address the colophony on pine, aside the sap on Sycamore, when supplementing the casks thru a sylvan terrain. A trek that encompasses wilted citrus plants with a fresh wood grit to the bold grains. In due course, a mid-sense that stipulates a robust sweetness, as ascribed to Black Cow bars, while Milk Duds melt near moist Profiteroles. The barrels are fairly soft to characterize profoundly, yet systemize in duration per the warming pauses. Namely, a Heaven Hill depiction that’s works to address vanilla, while the Woodford Reserve paints the soft fruited spices in back. Successively, an awareness on amyl alcohols with clocked oxidation on the assist, for promoting a vinous quality near Malmsey. The sequences continue on against the open circulations, which front dried orange slices to a leathery nuttiness, while chronicling charred oak

T: The barrel character plays on the bourbon casks, in a finer way than the oaked reserve, when first put into motion. Nonetheless, the kickoff is fairly calm on their sentience, as the rich bready chords vanguard the ordinance. One that navigates towards sticky toffee pudding, while addressing rich dark fruits, in the act of respecting the amalgamated – peppery – hop effect. With that in mind, an earthy pillar that trudges schwarzwald mountains to find wild fruits, besides uncovering redcurrants & black sapote. An involved sensitivity that caramelizes the middle on marshmallows, while maintaining an epicenter on the fig to raisin presets, as a more appreciative resonance builds to the aftertaste. The later stages on conditioning are kinder to the phenolic aldehydes with a lactone softness, considering the vanilla oaked context. Thereby, implying the maltol characterizations that enhance malts acuity, before addressing charred furfurals. There’s an idling element on forested planks, as the barrels address the soft (baking) spices that credit nutmeg & clove. Next in order, the mobility to candied almonds with an impending blackstrap veneer, which presages dried cocoa pods. The mechanisms have an unassuming say on the esters, as they murmur from a distance. Nonetheless, they offer an acetate means on the betterment, which fittingly aligns the dark floral – bittering – bearings. Elongated to corrosion thru a movement on audacious Hennessy, while the riders reaffirm (inflamed) parched rawhide

M: Boarders on a cloyingly thick surface with an inebriant temperateness, which is cautious to intelligently burn. There is a self-controlled structure on CO2, and one that’s further strained thru an uncapped openness. Unmistakably, a dense saccharinity subjected to the doughy malt demands, while a battling hop bill discreetly fields a greenery touch. Notwithstanding, the contributed cask reinforcement on the progressed (dry) attenuation, for a leathery – tannin derived – postscript

O: Encourages the presence of HH > WR, as bourbon coats the movement. Nevertheless, the intervals have a nimbleness to the oaked transfer, provided an opportunity to protract those intervals. Jagged in the inauguration over a palatable decorum that’s mediated around the whiffs, which lends a voluptuous openness to the heated sanctions. An intense grain bill that infracts the hop kick to favor the malt makings, yet tactful to not vulgarize & over-saturate the extremity","Dec 21, 2022"
A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,Alabama,4.63/5,Holding up really nicely. Traces of oxidation but still getting that abundance of booze-soaked raisin goodness you expect from DWTD.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,New Jersey,4.67/5,"2020 Version with Wax Dipped Can. 2 and a half years of aging.

Pours out the color of chocolate pudding. No foam formation. Not a surprise.

Nose, right off the bat, is something intriguing. I get a dominant, rich grainy bread note. I couldn't think of what it reminded me of, until it finally clicked. Ezekiel Bread. Earthy, grainy ezekiel bread as the base. Incredibly distinct. As for the rest, brown sugar, perhaps even venturing into molasses, figs and dates are emphasized greatly, and while borbon and oak are present, they do not dominate. Booze on the nose for sure as it warms. 

Taste follows much of the nose and expands upon it. The dark, rich, earthy and grainy bread is there still, but is dampened by the sweetness of the molasses and dark fruit presence. Oak and bourbon are still mild. Some smokiness that I didn't get from the nose. And there is a slight hint of that cherry flavored Tootsie Pop that I got similar to A Deal With Evil. But this has less cherry and more of an candy/chocolate Tootsie Roll flavor. The hops have withered away in bitterness, but I can taste that distinct profile they leave when they've been aged for a time.

Mouthfeel is very fullbodied. Soft, smooth, creamy. Despite its considerably density, it doesn't hang on the palate like oil. There is slight carbonation, but not none. ABV is very noticeable here. Drying, but not enough to tiresome and there is some cloying after a time. 

Overall, this is my first official A Deal With The Devil, and after saving it for a little while, this brew really delivers. I was a bit worried I may have saved it for too long, but at 17%, this one was a trooper. Always a pleasure to crack open an Anchorage for a special occasion.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,,Pennsylvania,4.65/5,"2022

Drinking this is comparable to drinking cold brew coffee concentrate that I forgot to water down. The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique. The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence. This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base. This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine, I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase. But, these are flavors I enjoy at intensity levels that no one else offers. If you are curious, I say try this once. This is leaps and bounds better than Wendigo.","Sep 05, 2022"

Clover,,New York,4.96/5,"Batch 3 bottle poured onsite at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, VT.

This one pours a clear golden yellow-ish orange, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like a sort of rustic oak thing, lemon peel, stone fruit, white wine, candied orange, and a dry hay like quality.

This is a blend of Flora, Art, and Ann, so it’s not surprising at all that this is really good. Having had all of those at this point, I wouldn’t say any one beer entirely stands out – this becomes its own thing that stands completely on its own, and might be better than each of the three titans that contributed. It’s very oaky, and orange-like, with a hay-like dry finish that is just so refreshing. There’s also stone fruit, white wine, dried lemon peel, with a restrained and very pleasant acidity.

This is light bodied, clean, lightly and pleasantly tart, and super drinkable.

This is absolutely fantastic, and might just crack the top 5 of Hill Farmstead beers that I’ve had – it’s just such a good and clearly deliberate blend.","Aug 13, 2023"

Clover,,Ohio,4.74/5,"Clear yellow-gold with minimal head formation dying to a clear, bubbly and uneven surface that disperses to a bubbly flat collar. The appearance was impressively identical between two different batches, which we were fortunate enough to enjoy in one evening.

Starting with batch 2, the oak is very expressive, yet gentle at the same time, backed by reduced citrus juice characteristics like grapefruit, orange and lemon. This was a smaller pour than I had of batch 3, but the contrasts were stark, while the more obscure parallels somehow held firm.

Out of batch 3, I perceive a larger presence of straw and young oak up front, but this quickly gives way to more acid than b2, while yet remaining palatably balanced. This acidity expresses like yellow raspberry and seedy passion fruit, countered by a frothy body that exhales refined oak threads. While that Ann oak in conjunction with the subtle funk of Art solidly affirm their support, it was clear that Flora's return to the blend saw her influence well exerted here.

This has been a very long time coming for me, and contrary to most experiences with meeting your idols, this did not let me down. I came away preferring b3, though absent of overwhelming confidence, as they were both phenomenal in different ways.","Mar 13, 2023"

aromas are originally sort of subdued when its colder, but always wonderfully enticing none the less. as it warms there is an immense bouquet of white wine, floral and grassy, lemon pith and peel, honey comb,toasted oak, vanilla, green apple, slightly musty earth, mellow funky straw quality and hints of nectarines. the beautiful wine, lemon, and honey scents set this one apart in my mind, potentially the best smelling beer ive encountered. 

on palate there is this wonderful vinous quality invoking white grape/white wine, mellow tannins, oak, vanilla, more of that crisp and tart green apple, lemon character, bright acidity, slightly lactic, hints of under ripe nectarines and peach skin, peppery spice, grassy and slightly floral, straw and earthy qualities. if i could explain in three words - bright, complex, clean. there is certainly a fair amount of tartness in here, with green apple, lemon, and under ripe white grape leading the way, but its kept well in check by funky complexity, wine flavors, grain character, and oaky notes. having cracked flora B7 two nights ago, I can definitely see the parallel flavors but this one has a ton more depth to it in terms of funky complexity. on mounthfeel is sort of still but somehow manages to retain this very subtle effervescence to it. 

this is perfect, prior to drinking this I was immensely hyped, and worried that a beer could not live up to such an expectation ... but what i encountered was a beer so far beyond what i could have imagined. 5++++","Mar 10, 2019"
Clover,,Massachusetts,4.77/5,"The beer pours a Clear gold with a thin white head that recedes immediately. It has high carbonation. The beer smells of lemon, orange, pear, and oak. It tastes lightly tart, with lemon, apples, pears, wine, and light funk. The feel is light and dry. An excellent Saison from Hill Farmstead.","Dec 15, 2018"

Clover,,Rhode Island,4.74/5,"375mL bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed bulb. 2015-03-12 bottled date. Original owner, purchased at the brewery during release.

Pours a lightly hazy sunny yellow effervescent body with a small white head that reduces pretty quickly to leave a ring of lacing and spotty lacing. 

Aromas are mesmerizing and complex and really intensify as it warms up. Citrus, white wine and oak sit center stage, with lightly fruity green apple and grapes not too far behind. There's a zesty pepperyness in there as well with straw and funk in the background. 

On the tongue is a delicate tartness with notes of citrus and funk, hay and grapes and a little grainy, dry white wine on the follow through with a solid amount of oak. Very, very smooth and drinkable, crisp and light with a little less carbonation than I was expecting. 

Clover is the real deal. It reminds me a lot of Flora with a bit more complexity and oak.","Oct 13, 2017"
Clover,,California,4.41/5,"Pours a clear golden straw color with little to no head - akin to a white wine. Aroma is light and nuanced - pepper, lemon, minor funkiness with a rounded body. Flavor is delightful and nuanced as well...tartness, some biscuit, lemon zest as well. A wonderful beer.","Oct 12, 2017"
Clover,,Illinois,4.56/5,"375ml bottle, poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 2.3.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.

The beer pours a bright golden straw color, hazy and cloudy complexion with a thin, soapy finger of white head, little retention but large swatches of soapy lace. The aroma is crazy bright, lemon acidity with soft grain at first bringing out beautiful wildflower aromas with a touch of earthy oak, white wine and light fruity funk. The flavors are beautifully tart, tangy citrus with light pitted stone fruits, peach and apricot with a delicate white wine acidity, smooth oak barrel adds a touch of heft and a bit of earthiness to balance the beer with soft pale grain, light yeasty funk and mineral water. The mouthfeel is good, a heavier more full body that lacks a bit of needed carbonation but still lively and bubbly with a coating and dry finish.

Verdict: A delicious blended beer from Hill Farmstead. Extremely flavorful and exceptionally well balanced, very tart and almost borders on sour but the restraint shown is wonderful. So complex, delicate and bright, bursting with flavor.","Aug 28, 2017"
Clover,,Germany,4.35/5,"Pours a bright, strawy golden color with a very small head, which immediately receeds to a thin lacing atop the liquid.

Smells of citraic cellar dust, together with a good amount of mushrooms and wet grass. Has a moldy funk presence to it, which acts nicely as a balance to the prominent citrus. Develops a gentle potato sweetness, together with lots of old hay and a whiff of dried wild berries - pretty complex and well nuanced.

Drinks very soft with a sparkly effervescence in the finish, due to a mineralic quality. Light bodied, easy drinking, while unfolding a plethora of flavors at the same time.

Tastes of sweet straw and white bread dough, which immediately get coated up by dry lemon pulp and a mineralic, bubbly refreshment. Dried white wine grapes and a prominent acidity, tamed by the funk set the bar once the lemon bitterness is dialed in. Turns more mature and subltle the longer this is on the palate, with blueberries, lemon grass, and a scoop of orange jam. Finishes with its initial, calming softness, citrus, which almost entirely has lost its bitterness and soft oak among fruity white grapes and white bread dough. 

Tasty throughout, this one has a lot lambic reminiscences. For example its funk and higher acidity, but those get mellowed effectivly by the barrels and a lovely sweet peak, creating a powerful, old and complex Saison.","Aug 28, 2017"

Clover,,Oregon,4.53/5,"375ml bottle, served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.

Pours a bright lemon yellow body, slightly hazy, one finger white head, perfect retention with bits of lacing. Smell is oak, mineral, farmhouse funk, slight straw, mild acetic acidity, touch of zest and citrus. Flavour follows, citrus, zest, hay, light farmhouse funk, mild vinegar acidity, light vinous character, mineral, bit of oak. A lot going on here, but this is a fairly restrained beer, really drinkable with a fair bit of complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, perfectly carbonated, dangerously drinkable that one has to pause to appreciate the beer for what it is. Overall, a very tasty barrel aged saison. This didn't have as much of Flora as it did Art; but I've never had Ann so I can't draw a direct comparison to that one, unfortunately.","Jun 04, 2017"
Clover,,New Jersey,4.75/5,"A: Head is approximately half an inch high with some retention, and stylish lacing. The pour itself is lively; slightly transparent via a glowing golden, orange color

S: Aroma is of vinous acidity with grapes, melon, lemon, citrus, and slight candy appeal. The brett, oak, and malt play nicely amongst a quite floral, herbal, and earthy brew 

T: Palate is once again kept busy with the subtleties of melon, honey, lemon, grapes, vanilla, some barrel character, and fitting acidity. The convergence of earthy funk, fruit, and dryness to the “taste” is exquisite 

M: Medium carbonation with a light to medium body/feel. Skillfully balanced: soft and pillowy, fruity, sweet, creamy, and barnyard funk 

O: Spick-and-span – Ann, Art, and Flora are proficiently blended; a delicate, thought-provoking story","May 31, 2017"
Anabasis,,New York,4.38/5,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours rich, muddy, and dense. No head, no lace, huge, oily, chunky legs. Nose is booze, raisin, anise, brown sugar, sweet soy sauce, and plum. Very aromatic. Beer opens dried purple fruit. Notes of prunes, sweet soy sauce, anise, and raisin. Layers of brown sugar, molasses in the middle. Bone dry and boozy at the end. Syrup, tobacco, oak, and almost a salty molasses in the aftertaste. Fantastic complexity. Body is full with low carbonation. Thick, oily, and chewy on the palate. Boozy, bone dry finish with a sticky aftertaste. 

Very solid. Great complexity.","Aug 06, 2023"
Anabasis,,Indiana,4.65/5,"Appearance - the beer was almost black in appearance with some variation in color and little carbonation.

Smell - The nose was composed of the barrel and dark fruits. It lean toward the sweet side.

Taste - The bourbon barrel was strong with this one, but not hot. Notes of port, fruit, leather, tobacco, cherries, and oak were present. Needless to say, it was a diverse pallet. The port and oak notes really stood out. This was a sipper.

Mouthfeel - The body was not overly thick, especially when judged to today’s outrageous standards. Carbonation was muted.

Overall - This is an elite barleywine.","Aug 06, 2023"
Anabasis,,Illinois,4.65/5,"Blend #5. Thanks to Luscious_Malfoy for hooking me up with this bottle! So the appearance is not a looker: sludgy brown body, no head, but the rest of this beer is breathtaking. Big rich and complex rustic bourbon barrel, barley, toasted caramel, tons of dark fruit, rye, molasses, char, black licorice, vanillins, and leather nose. Taste is similar: adds slight anise no licorice and char though, oxidized sugars with attached earthiness, vanillins emerge over time more. Feel is thick and warm with great barrel character, barley splashes on the palate in such a smooth way, luxurious and complex, though heavy. Met the hype!","May 06, 2023"
Anabasis,,Minnesota,4.63/5,Blend 5 poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip. Perfectly sweet. Nicely thick. This ranks up their with some of the best Revolution BW in my opinion.,"Mar 27, 2023"
Anabasis,,New Jersey,4.02/5,"A: A zinnwaldite brown discharge to the carafe with a Fisher Cat disguise, as the highlights near a Ruddy Duck tint. The stabilizing agents on the collar lack the hydrophobic polypeptides to substantiate; nonetheless, they are attuned to the design through brevity. As such, an output that has a Cassava toned neck, and a Roman Mushroom hued rim. The latticework suffers from the negative – appropriate – materials, but there’s a residue leeway using gentle agitation. This necessities at the launch, which is hastily cut inside the minute(s), as a new nuance defines the drippy – cathedral – windows

S: The blend plays to the barrels with an accompany netting over the malts, while thickly layering esters atop hop sanities. Chiefly, a presence on acetates that pushes a solvent characteristic above the finer points, as they struggle – against epoxy – at the outset. Nonetheless, an oak derivative that midriffs on furfurals, which benefit the grain bill, by advancing the sweet caramel notations around Colomba di Pasqua. The road has a Rabitos Royale cusp with a cherry cordial prompt, as sultanas devise Boerenjongens. Moreover, a chord on orange blossom honey, which pursues a robust earthiness, while transmitting coniferous woodlands. This simulates treks covering Douglas Fir & Scots Pine trees, while natural Copal resins air above. Subsequently, a balmy increment to the hour, for attuning burnt sugar toffee to the skins of grapes, as the schedule concatenates on ethyl hexanoates. Namely, aniseed upon sundried apples, while the cask to malt ratio encompasses an oak plank grit on Moravian Wafers. The ventilation across the clocked periods delivers caved Moscatel congruities, which meld Raisin Marmalatas into eucalyptus shrubs. In due course, a @ > 80°F that sticks an aridness on guaiacols over beeswax, while a meerschaum presence stains vintage – vinylon – coats

T: An isoamyl octanoate shadow to the deeply drawn hemicelluloses, where the oak structures pitch lipid derivatives. There is a solvent continuation, which is calmer than the odors let on, yet a paint to wood varnish – remnant – remains over the initial records. The direction incorporates Daim bars to German nougat sweets, as Vínartertas concoct. Underneath, a drawing on teakwood, by a deciduous nature, beyond vanilla agroforests. Secondly, a recognition – of the diastatic enzyme conversions – that benefits the malt saccharifications over maple crème caramels, while drawing on Peruvian coffees. There is an earthy hop poise to the residual sweetness, which lends a woodsy bite to the course. In doing so, the blend advances without choking, and furthers the development behind acetates, as tied to the cask enhancements. A development that’s constantly subjected to the °F upticks, as open air addresses the carafe, for an oxidized maturity outside the porous wood doings. In this situation, the process provokes vintage Armagnacs, where peculiar leathers top candid fruits, besides dated mink boots against flue-cured tobacco. A continuation that hints at shabby – masonry – chimneys, while phenolic compounds deliver eugenols over the charred lactone sentients

M: A texture that delineates a sharp bite across barbed resins, which imbalances the kick-off. Coupled with, tannin constitutions, for elevating (& refining) dry executions against a soft glutinousness. As such, a dexterity with a sensitive viscosity through a warming decree, yet careful on the inebriant malaises, as carbonation brings a soft effervescence. The output lends a harmonic bitterness with a greenery balance, by the phased hop pillars 

O: Emphasizes the 26mths to 19mths with a warm barrel perceptiveness, which is slightly furthered outside the necessary transfers, considering a start that battles to make inroads. A blend that has a robust grain bill, where temperaments platform in steps, as reconciliations take place on the divergences","Jan 12, 2023"

Anabasis,,Pennsylvania,4.49/5,"Blend #6

This extremely deep and dense, absolutely American in character. Lots of charred toffee accented by hints of candied nuts, bakers chocolate, dates, and raisins up front. The finish adds intense, woody tobacco, leafy hops, light spice, earthy vanilla, and an intensely boozy exhale. I also get a pretty strong molasses note throughout Absolutely nothing subtle or subdued about this, but it's a helluva lot of fun to drink. Falls just half a tick shy of living up to the hype.

Anabasis,,New York,4.8/5,"Blend #4.

This one pours a very thick-looking and murky dark brown, nearly black, with a very small head, and no lacing.

This smells like caramel, leather, chocolate, oak, sherry, port, spice, maple, toffee, bourbon, and tobacco.

This is truly excellent stuff. It's got a lot of barrel, and it's much drier and more nimble than some of the absolute saccharine beasts you get in this style. There's a dry toasted oak thing, and the bourbon comes across swinging leather belts across the face. There's some spice and vanilla from the barrel, too. The base is more caramel and toffee than some of that dark dried fruitiness you often get from the style, but I do get a kind of dry sweetness, almost like sherry or port - that honestly could be some pleasant oxidization. The beer was in barrels for two years, so it's very possible.

This is medium bodied, creamy, and very rich and thick, with absolutely no booze character to it. This is 14%, and the booze is hidden just so well - it's a miracle in malt flexing.

It's easy to see why this is so well-regarded. It's really one of the best barleywines I've ever had.","May 18, 2020"
Anabasis,,Delaware,4.56/5,"This was Batch #2. Toffee, caramel, bourbon, and earthy fruit. Easy to see why this brew is in such high demand. Cory King is a magician, flexing his muscle in every style.","Feb 14, 2020"
Anabasis,,Ohio,4.41/5,"Semi-clear mahogany to prune juice dark brown with faint purple hues and a short fuzzy tan head that quickly dies to a used motor oil looking surface. There might be some tiny chunks of barrel char towards the bottom of the pour, but they are minimal.

Viscous, almost syrupy, yet silky smooth, Anabasis b3 kicks off with dark fruit and Reisen before a sudden, surprisingly woody barrel presence. It's a little splintery at first, and quite mature, before developing some notes of decadence with time, such as nutty nougat, maple, and hints of caramel apple.

Quite delicious, but maybe a little too woody, so I have a few other preferred favorites in this category. Frankly, I'm still surprised by the lofty pedestals that barleywines like this are placed while breweries like Cigar City just casually put out bangers on the regular that are AT LEAST just as good.

---

Sharing a b5 bottle with friends mid-May 2021, I'm finding it to be surprisingly chocolatey. While there's a ton of bourbon barrel on back end, it's simultaneously less woody overall, allowing room for the darker malts to really edge this ever closer to stout territory. The charred oak adds classic nougat impressions, but also some unexpected marzipan qualities.

It's overall less astringent and hoppy than I remember b3, and as such, I'm enjoying it even more, even if it is drifting further away from American, or even English #life. As such, I'm hesitant to alter my already fairly high score.","Feb 04, 2020"

Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,,Kentucky,4.52/5,"Putting a little pep in your step and numbing the senses all at once, 3 Floyd's pink peppercorn and cinnamon Dark Lord variant takes this Imperial Stout to the nuclear level.... and with snacks.

Jet black and pouring like ink, Chemtrailmix alerts the nose with a strong, savory and sultry blend of coffee, cocoa, whisky, spice, port wine and sherry. As the inky elixir hits the tongue, the taste is enlivened with the sweetness of brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, toffee, honey and caramel with hints of chocolate and condensed fruit.

As the stout extends across the middle palate, the sweetness slowly turns to dry. A rise of espresso, baker's chocolate, roasted nuttiness and campfire char keeps the session hefty before the spices of cinnamon and peppercorn tease the palate with a gentle dry prickle. Trending warm with rye whisky and oak, the late palate trends coconut-like with vanilla, earthen grit and caramel with those savory aged port and sherry savory qualities.

Full bodied, pleasantly chewy and off-cloying, Chemtrailmix finishes malty-dry, spicy and very warm. With impressions of sherry and coconut lingering in aftertaste, this calls for a long, patient and sipping session with high rewards and a surprising rate of drinkability if you can tolerate the combination of whisky and spice.","Jul 10, 2023"
Chemtrailmix - Rye Barrel,,Indiana,4.74/5,"Pours a pure, coal black color with a sudsy dark tan head that is fairly quick to flee. The nose features the cinnamon up front and with extreme prejudice - this is bigly cinnamon. There’s also a nice spicy note from the peppercorn and some chocolate and a subtle barrel note.

The barrel is more pronounced on the taste, and a perfect, spicy complement to the peppercorn flavor - and the still bigly cinnamon, which is delicious. There’s also chocolate and a surprising bit of stone fruit. There’s a LOT going on here and it’s all magnificent, IMHO.

A: Pours jet black with a thick cap of dark brown, large bubbled head. Dissipates quickly, leaving a thin ring. So-so retention and no lacing.

S: Ground cinnamon dominates, with an undertone of blackened roast, dark roast coffee, light oak, dark chocolate bar, and a bit of black licorice, whiskey, plum, sherry-like oxidation, and vanilla. 

T: Cloyingly sweet. Again, ground cinnamon is overwhelming, alongside a little black licorice, plum, dark melted chocolate, whiskey, and a bit of oak on a long, sweet, cinnamon-y, slightly hot finish. 

M: Medium-full body, a bit chewy, medium-light carbonation. Medium-light alcohol warmth with a slight burn.

Aromas are heavenly - cinnamon-bourbon vanilla, dark chocolate. The mouth matches the nose with a perfectly balanced medly of cinnamon and bourbon, vanilla, horchata, a little bit of spice on the finish, leaving a slightly roasty flavor on the palette. Rich mouthfeel.

One of the best stouts I've ever tasted. I just opened a bottle of 2019 Barrel Aged Abraxas and this blows it out of the water (although I've heard 2019 BAA is not a great batch)","Nov 24, 2019"

The cinnamon hides/tones down a bit of the sweetness of the overall brew, yet seems to be enhanced in flavor. A great addition to the BA DL family.","Aug 02, 2019"

Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,,New York,5/5,"Phenomenal. Poured cold to a Glencairn glass. Dark burnt caramel color, minimal fuse-fast head. Aroma is unexpectedly heavy prune with a base of leather and light vanilla. First sips are laden with bourbon bite, I mean a heavy hit of hot but enjoyably sweet spirit. The barrel wood is forward, bringing images of saturated staves oozing booze and tannins. I don’t even know the ABV but it’s easy to kick back a big swig…though I only have this one lonely can to enjoy. Mouthfeel is full, with a nice stickiness. The caramel bites are all over the middle and end flavors. It carries traits similar to a stout/barleywine cuvée, like Anchorage’s Endless Endings, wherein there is a dark malt middle flavor once the sip is gone and you’re enjoying the linger. I also find it similar to Fremont’s B6K, but with a much more subdued and harmonious sweetness profile. Next time, I’ll try to get a 4-pack. I had a meeting that day…in hindsight, it was with an asshole, so my time would have been better spent ordering beer online.","Jun 15, 2023"

It's actually quite amazing how hidden the 16.8% ABV is on this one. Getting more dark fruit with time. Figs, blackberries, black currant, and slight tobacco.

Here it is, the beer that got my to finally use Tavour after I’ve had it downloaded for years. Once I heard that they might get some I got my ass right on there. After just recently finally getting to try regular VSOJ, the timing is perfect for this insanely decadent double barrel aged version. Let’s see if it lives up to the hype

Pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but has wonderful legs

This shows so much complexity on the nose, similar to VSOJ but leaning more heavily into the fruit. I'm picking up on aromas of dates, sweet bourbon, molasses, roasted peanut, fig, brown sugar, toasted oak, burnt caramel, rye bread, tobacco, and light vanilla

For everything going on here, this has a gentle evolution to it. Super complex but I wouldn't call it aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sweet bourbon, toasted oak, fig, black cherry, sweet maple, molasses, burnt caramel, rye bread, toffee, light vanilla, and red grape. The swallow brings notes of charred oak, sweet bourbon, roasted peanut, cocoa powder, black cherry, toasted walnut, tobacco, sticky caramel, vanilla, molasses, light port wine, and rye bread

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and not anywhere near the listed 16.8%. Barleywine should not go down this easy

Holy shit, this is amazing. It's up there with some of the best beers I've ever had. I loved VSOJ, but this definitely beats it out. I'm so glad I got back on Tavour for this, and even more glad I have another can left","Feb 19, 2023"
Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,,New York,4.59/5,"This one pours a golden dark brown-ish color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like concentrated caramel syrup, port wine, charred oak, floral spice, vanilla, black cherry paste, spicy rye, and milk chocolate.

This is much sweeter than regular VSOJ, and really most of the Revolution oeuvre. It’s a knock only in that it makes regular VSOJ better to me – but Revolution is really only in competition with itself and the rest of its dense and malty catalogue. We all win in this competition. The barrel character is immense here, sticky sweet, but charred and almost floral, with lots of rye and almost port-like flavors.

This is medium bodied, slightly syrupy, like concentrated barleywine jelly almost. It’s not really boozy at all.

Revolution calls this the pinnacle of their barrel program. For some it might be – but regular VSOJ is the zenith for me. Nonetheless, this is just stupid good and I’m so glad to be able to try it.","Feb 16, 2023"

Double Barrel V.S.O.J.,,California,4.68/5,"Beer pours a dark amber, that’s transparent in the light. Rests in the glass as a very dark brown, with amber edges. Head emerges briefly, but is gone in a blink.

Unlike original V.S.O.J., the aroma is not dominated by alcohol, despite the 2.8% higher ABV. It’s not huge, but still provides notes of dark fruits, fruit leathers, caramel, and a good amount of oaky barrel.

This is where things change a bit. Flavors are Sugar Daddy sweet. It’s not overwhelming, but definitely a departure from the single barrel version. The aftertaste is where this shines, though. Give it a second, and it just erupts with flavors of dark caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, stewed dark fruits and subtle coconut. All are sweet flavors, so I am missing that balance. The oaky char, the leather, the tobacco.. the more savory notes that offset the sugary sweetness. All that being said, it’s a fantastic barleywine that is frighteningly easy to drink for almost 17%.

""Proudly brewed only in Chicago"" on the can. Is that a dig at Goose Island? Anyway, myself and a non beer friend logged in right at the moment these went online and only I was able to snag 8 cans for $60/4 pack. With the fervor and price I paid for these cans, this better be phenomenal right? It's a DOUBLE barrel. We're past single barrels now. Why not triple or quadruple? Those will be $80 and $100/4 pack when they inevitably make them I am sure. So all the hype aside, how's the beer? The two things that stick out right away to me is that this is a sweet one compared to say Goose's Old Fitz barleywine from this year. I think it'll be balanced enough though to not be cloying for me over the entire 12oz can. Secondly the 16.8% abv is very well hidden to me. I can tell that I'm feeling it (even after a large meal) but I don't taste an alcohol burn at all. There's SO much barrel though which I love. This to me is the sign of a truly world class ba offering. The beer has a nice brown color with very little carbonation showing. I don't get a ton on the nose which is disappointing. There's barrel and figgy caramel notes, but it's muted. As with all Rev ba beers, I wish it would be a bit thicker. So overall this is a world class beer for me. I can't say if it's better than either other VSOJ's since it's been awhile since I've had them. I think my next can will be opened up along side an Old Fitz Goose just to see who did the best barleywine this year. I'm guessing this will edge out.","Jan 28, 2023"

Julius,,Texas,4.44/5,"Poured from a can into a teku glass
Appearance – The beer pours a very hazy orange color with a big puffy head of off-white foam. THE head has a great level of retention, fading very slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell -The aroma is big of a musty grainy and bready smell mixed with lots of raw hop aromas of a herbal and earthy nature. There are other citrus aromas of orange and tangerine as well as hints of grapefruit mixed within. Notes of apricot and some grass are in there as well, giving a rather raw and sorta green smell to the brew overall.
Taste – The taste starts out drier than one would anticipate from the nose. It begins with a mix of bready and cracker malt flavors combined with hop flavors of a very potent herbal and grapefruit hop. Notes of a floral and pine hop flavor are there as well, but these tastes are light in comparison to the herbal hop. All the hop flavors are rather “raw” in nature, having an almost hop pellet like flavor associated with them. These potent flavors are the dominant ones throughout much of the taste. While said, there is a decent showing of fruit flavors of tangerine, peach, and apricot, as well as a hint of mango. The mix of sweet, bready and hop take the taste to its end, where it leaves one with a rather green hopped and slightly fruity and malty taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body is a bit more on the creamy and chewy side with a carbonation level that is on the more moderate side. For the rich hop and malt flavors the feel is well done and makes for a nice easy sipper.
Overall – A very nice brew overall. I think I like this better than the King Julius as it is more approachable from my standpoint, but hits all the same high notes as the king variety. Big and flavor and drinkability with a nice blend of hop, malt, and fruit.",Saturday at 02:26 PM

Appearance: Deep gold color with 3-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a few minutes, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 6.8% listed on the can.

This is an excellent New England IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. Another outstanding IPA from Tree House, and only second to King Julius. I like the overall balance, and would buy this again.","Oct 14, 2022"

Taste is surprising some fruity enhanced malt but nothing like the sweet very fruity nose. Nice hop bite citrus, some spicy notes that move to dry zesty finish with lingering hops. I normally like hoppy hazy brews and this one is good, just little weird it so different from the nose. If you love soft fruity hazy IPA's not sure you would enjoy this one.

Mouthfeel is about medium but the zesty carbonation makes it seem lighter. Personally just a touch too much for my tastes.

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.

The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.

The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.

A - Hazy medium orange gold colored pour with bright white, creamy lacing circling the top of the glass.

S - Massive tart, jammy, apricot with a little bit of funk going down.

T - Not as sour / tart as the nose would suggest (though still puckering). Lots of apricot jam tartness that lingers on the palate (and then some). 

M - Big body with vibrant carbonation giving a soft texture leaving the entire mouth watering.

O - Straight up apricot with just the right amount of twangy zing. Pretty darn impressive and something special right here.","Jan 29, 2023"

L - Pale, hazy apricot gold pour with a topping of thin white foam, which disperses to a mild lacing.

S - Tart, sugary apricot jam with perhaps a touch of cinnamon and creamy vanilla.

T - Sharp sourness, almost vinegary acidity, underripe fruit, and a slight doughy grain flavor.

F - Stinging carbonation, juicy to start with a dry finish.

A beautifully crafted lambic which avoids the pitfalls of many other examples of the style (too sweet or too woody). The fruit is used to soften the lambic base. Excellent!","Jan 01, 2023"

Holy. Fucking. Hell. I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now

Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind

This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars

I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA!","Sep 13, 2021"

My Thanksgiving special beer for the day. First time having this, so there’s a lot of anticipation. It’s a gorgeous looking beer and as it warmed the smell opened up to lots of fruit and funk. Tasting it, I get an amazing balance of fruit and funk. It could even be a bit funkier for my pallet, but it’s amazing. It’s tart but not too tart.

Fou' Foune,,Massachusetts,4.56/5,"L -- Deep golden orange body with moderate haze and two fingers of solid white head produced with gentle pour. Good retention and lacing
S -- This is indeed a very fragrant beer. Tons of fresh apricot, fruit leather, subtle barnyard funk, lemon acidity, hay, perfumed floral, mango, strawberry candy
T -- Great balance between the lemony tartness and oaky astringency of the base lambics alongside the subtly sweet fruitiness of the Bergeron apricots. Super complex and nuanced, this is not one of those completely out of balance sours that a lot of American brewers are producing these days
F -- Light mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Nice and lively, quite fluffy as well
O -- What an absolute surprise to see this suddenly show up for to-go growlers at Row 34 in Boston, especially in the midst of all that's going on in the world. At $40/32oz this is the second highest I've ever paid for a beer, just behind the $50 for a bottle of Drie Fonteinen Framboos

Fou' Foune,,Massachusetts,4.61/5,"750ml bottle decanted into small snifters.

Golden-orange in color with good clarity. Bracing tartness on the attack, but as the initial shock to the palate subsides, it opens into bright and beautiful flavors of fresh apricots, orange blossom and floral notes, and a very delicate and nuanced funk layer. Soft oak to round things out. It’s so fucking good. Completely captivating in its fresh and lively fruit flavor and in its balance.

---

And at DLD 2023, I return back to the place I first had a version of this beer, this time a 2022 vintage. it's perhaps better than I remember it, exhibiting more rich mocha wafer qualities this time. Maybe I was just too rip-roaring drunk to care to enjoy it the last time around, but even though my original description started out harsh, my rating wasn't, thus I'm not going to bump it up much further from my original 4.17.","May 24, 2019"
Monster Tones,,Oregon,4.87/5,"2019 vintage. 650ml bottle, served in a snifter glass.

Pours a dark black body, foreboding, thick and black. Oily, nice legs with a one finger mocha head, good retention, not much lacing. Again, fair bit of legs behind this one.

Aroma is a massive, balanced and complex amalgamation of coconut, vanilla and light maple sweetness. It's pretty amazing how all this comes together. There's a big bourbon presence also, a bit warming and hot, buttressed by a big milk chocolate candy bar sweetness. A fair bit of roast coffee, oak, touch of whiskey smoke. Damn. The coconut and vanilla are massive, and I mean massive. It reminds me of the first time I had Vanilla Bean Dark Lord- except there is even more pastry coconut behind it. It takes that massive vanilla and bourbon, and adds coconut onto it. The coffee is almost an afterthought, but it does keep it from getting too sweet.

The flavour follows the nose. I don't need to list any more superlatives, but it has a really nice balance to all of the adjuncts- mainly coconut and toasted marshmallows, with some maple sweetness, light coffee adding just a touch of roasty balance along with the big dark chocolate fudge. Incredible- there are stouts out there with the same adjuncts that fail to achieve that intense balance. If I had to quibble, and it's really a very small quibble, I thought it might be a little hotter than I'd like. The bourbon heat is strong here, but I think for most people, that's probably a selling point.

Full bodied, fudgy and thick, substantial with appropriate carbonation- creamy, coating, and decadent. truly a liquid dessert, wonderful intensely aromatic and palate-coating adjunct flavours with a massive intensity that somehow all comes together as perfectly as one needs it to be.

For me, the best beer I've had in some years. To me, this represents the next step in the evolution of barrel-aging, imperial stouts and adjuncts. Beers like Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, Kentucky Brunch, etc. pushed the envelope as far as it could, but this beer has taken the pastry stout to even dizzier heights.","Apr 08, 2019"

Very Green,,Pennsylvania,3.76/5,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Purchased directly from the brewery. Canned on 9/14/2022, so this is just 22 days old.

Look: Pours an opaque bright yellowish orange color with a frothy off-white head that has small- to medium-sized bubbles.

Smell: I can see why they call this ""Very Green."" It has a lot of green grassy and piney aromas. There's also a lot of tropical and citrus fruit aromas - pineapple, orange, grapefruit. Creamy notes also. Smells like many other Tree House beers that I have had before.

Taste: It's a bit more interesting than the nose suggests. Up front, it's fruity and juicy. But that personality trait quickly fades as the finish is long and bitter, yet not very aggressive at first. It really is a ""green"" finish with big vegetal, grassy flavors including pine, mint, lots of citrus pith. The second sip was much less juicy and sweet up front; already the second sip is bitter up front as the bitterness builds on the palate. As much as you get the flavor of the fruit of the pineapple, you get the flavor of the green pineapple stalks.

Feel: The mouthfeel is soft and creamy.

Overall: I've said it before and I am sadly saying it again. I am largely unimpressed by Tree House New England IPAs. This beer is just not very flavorful or enjoyable for me. There are so many other beers that I would rather be drinking. I can still honestly say that it is a well-made beer, but it's just not made according to my tastes/preferences and therefore I rated it accordingly. I guess that so many people like this beer because it gives a ""hop fix"" along with a super creamy mouthfeel. It's just lacking some elements to make it an enjoyable beer for me.","Oct 06, 2022"

Poured from a can (14Jul2021) into a Tree House Teku

L: pours a completely opaque, creamy and slightly glowing yellow orange. Massive dense and fluffy white head that fades slowly, leaving excellent chunky lacing as it does. Visually it’s DIPA perfection

S: huge, rich tropical nose right as I crack the can. Pouring into the glass I get huge waves of overripe pineapple, orange, grapefruit, lime. Mix of flesh and pith, dripping fruit with a slight earthy dankness to it. Nice citrusy bitterness as well. Really great layers to the aroma, from bright fruit to richer, more dank overripe/earthy notes

T: delivers the nose very well, immense depth to the very fruit-forward swallow. Mix of pineapple and pithy grapefruit to open, the acidity builds nicely into the middle. Some mango and peach starts for emerge. Really excellent pairing of bright and fresh sweeter fruit with a more acidic, citrusy character. As it warms find that pineapple comes through more, like it. Medium+/long- finish, that pleasant slightly drying acidity carries through

F: medium carbonation, medium body. Very smooth, not overly “full” or heavy/creamy. Superbly drinkable, mildly drying

O: the second batch of Very Green I’ve had, it’s easily one of the best beers I’ve ever had and probably my favorite DIPA. Looks aren’t everything but this beer is stunning. The nose is just incredible waves of tropical flavor, with the swallow delivering across the board","Oct 05, 2022"

Taste: I don't think it's as citrusy as people are saying, but that isn't to say there is no citrus/tropical fruit. Fruity up front then quickly transfers to a puckering bitter floral/piney taste. Almost reminiscent of a west coast at the end if it wasn't for such a creamy mouthfeel.

$20.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It's bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it's way through all of the sweet malt (it's got to be more bitter but you just can't tell) but there's also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother. The head has held up really well and it's left some beautiful lace all around the glass. I'm quite pleased with Very Green and feel that it's actually better than Green but that's just my opinion. Regardles, it remains a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Very Green,,Washington,4.21/5,"16oz can courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ.

Poured into my Precious Things Teku (my one and only Teku), this was an opaque yellow-orange color, with a good sized & creamy looking off-white head. Lots of lace.

Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits. Initially just sweet fruit scent, as it warms a more bitter, pithy aroma seeps into the background.

More complex than the nose lets on, although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges, Midway through there's a more pithy, bitter happiness. The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before. Things finish off smoothly, with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate.

Medium bodied, with a mouth feel that's a bit creamy.

Very Green,,Connecticut,5/5,"I remember the experience of opening my first ever can of Heady Topper back in 2012 and being floored because I had never experienced anything like it. I remember thinking to myself, “there is no way anything will ever match this.”

Well, I had my first Very Green in 2020 and recently picked some more up from Charlton. As I sit here and drink one that’s a bit over a month old I felt compelled to come on here and leave my first review in years. 

This is beer nirvana and from the thousand or so beers I’ve tried in the last 13 years, nothing else surpasses this. I’ve had all the core offerings from Treehouse (and many of the eclectic rare ones) and while some are close to this, this truly checks every box for me as being a perfect beer. I cannot provide any details different from the other reviewers above and below, aside from my own subjective experience and the way this beer makes me feel.

Very Green,,Illinois,4.75/5,"Trying plenty of tree house this week, most have not met the hype, but this one exceeded it! Orange juice appearance with a full white head, plenty of lacing left behind. Huge aromas of tropical fruits: especially melon, pineapple, and kiwi, pithy citrus, piney and floral hops burst through. Taste is a swirling mix of melon, pineapple, mango, kiwi, lemon and grapefruit pith, orange zest, and weedy and piney hops. Feel is lush, juicy, well hopped textures, and full while maintaining a highly drinkable body. Really impressed, might be the best tree house I have had to date","Dec 29, 2021"

Very Green,,New Jersey,3.75/5,"16 ounce can in a tulip IPA glass. Canned on 11/5/2021. 8.3% abv.

Heavy citrus rind and tropical aromas. Some pineapple, mango, crawl space dank, and alcohol.

Alcohol forward. Alcohol saturated citrus and tropical fruit juice. 

Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and boozy. The claimed bitterness is backseat to sweetness.

It’s okay as neipas go, but it’s more of a juicy mixed drink than a beer, to me that is. Again, I’m overrating it so not to look it. Meh.","Dec 03, 2021"
Assassin,,Indiana,4.79/5,"Appearance - The beer was an inky black color with a dark head clinging to the sides of the glass. 

Smell - Dark malts and barrel were the primary parts of the nose. 

Taste - Initially, the profile was thick boozy dark chocolate. The profile with sweet, but nowhere close to being cloying. Notes of raisin, tobacco, and a hint of vanilla followed. The chocolate goodness lingered in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel - The feel was thick and sticky, clinging to the sides and top of the tongue. 

Overall - This beer was definitely hype worthy.","Apr 24, 2023"
Assassin,,New Jersey,4.46/5,"A: A carbon black discharge to the carafe with a tap shoe hue, while the decanter rests on a woodsmoke tone, before the radiance pins a coloration near Kurotobi. The transfer(s) occur across natural nucleated sites, which avoids the unwanted lipids/impurities on the cross-reactions, for solidifications. Accordingly, a collar formation to the inch, as latticework – marginally – pushes through a rushed retreat. The brim comes in towards the .25in, which clings to the periods that reach 1cm, while the hours further the detachments per the foam-negative materials. With this in mind, the palette to the neck has a dark beige peak, as the rushed retreat has a mars brown rim. In turn, a viscosity factor that plays to the annulling properties aforesaid, which support the nuanced droplets that attune the advanced (teary) arches 

S: Malts frame the dexterities above a soft hop bill, while the oak casks work to build a complicated mass around the aged aldehydes. An ignition that politely connotes La Bête Noire with a Cajeta glaze, as figgy duff pairs alongside prunes + flame raisins. There is an oak stave to plank presence in exercise, which adds a dynamic balance to the sweet midsections. Supplementary to this, a calm hop effect that reinforces the barrel toned landscapes, when symbolizing forested alder to shagbark hickory. All the while, a ventilated deduction on the vintage, beyond the bettering cask aspects. This comes at a trained interval, which nears ≥68°F, for softening & blooming the – hourly – abstractions. Correspondingly, an enlightened (smart) complication that comes without additives, where the stability is maintained & rooted through coordination. The progression optimizes the breathing periods, by characterizing Palo Cortado through rawhide over clay pipes, outside the dried fruit subtexts over Atomic Fireballs. Moreover, a structure that continuously engages in complex polymers, when denoting lignins across tannins, in the act of rolling dry constitutions 

T: Soft barrel entitlements to the conversions set by diastatic enzymes, where hemicelluloses contribute to the cultured caramelization(s). Namely, maltol developments to the plot, for signifying doughy accounts on Nussbrezels under a Crème brûlée guise, as bourbon coats Chelan cherries + Moyer plums. The notations have a light implication on the makings that analog MalvaBons, while lightly addressing the oak lactones thru coconut. The age offers a refined sense on the phenolic aldehydes, as they lend vanilla by vanillin, which comes with a molasses – charred – nature. Howbeit, cautious to not exceedingly burn amid the oxidized transfers, across the carafe, where Fahrenheit gets incrementally pushed. There is a leathery standing behind the hydrolysable workings, which offer a steadying composure to the sweet malt passages. This is furthered by a low toned bitterness, when detailing the dark rosin inflections. Sequentially, a blooming allowance that recapitulates the sensed perceptions on sherry, where an oxidized nuttiness supplants English toffee. The sequences have dry – tannin derived – cessations, while carefully regulating spiced eugenols & smoked guaiacols, against the softly spoken (developed) acetaldehydes 

M: An intensity behind C₂H₆O that’s courteous to not suffocate, when attenuating sweetness. Thus, a treacly to thick mitigation with an alleviating bite, while the smooth ebullitions amalgamate over the tempered – carbonated – tiers. A feel that’s accompanied by age, besides the aeriated drafts, for paving a weathered maturity 

O: The degradations on hemicelluloses are rich in their pursuit on furfurals above ethyl acetates, which is fittingly appropriate, for perceiving malt. Oak compounds are continuous in the upsurge, of clocked intervals, as they are paired alongside the relaxed wooded hops. Correspondingly, a construction that offers more harmony, when providing the time with an uncapped patience","Mar 31, 2023"

Assassin,,Washington,4.21/5,"On tap at Ansari's in Eagan MN the other day (the 2021version). Was very excited to see this beer on tap, even at the price point ($14.99 for a 4 ounce pour).

The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention. Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout. On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry. Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long. As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish. It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate. 

This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher. Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well. I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin). Whatever. Each to their own. This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again.","May 20, 2022"

Assassin,,Washington,4.64/5,"2019 vintage poured on dec 19, 2020 

Pours a viscous used motor oil color with a mocha color head that leaves minimal lacing. 

Nose is of dark fruit, vanilla, leather, dark chocolate, and faint oak. This is culmination of great barrel and base beer. 

Taste follows nose with subtle dark fruit, dark chocolate, lingering vanilla and barrel character. The taste once again really showcases the great use of barrels and base stout. 

Feel is where this beer falls short. It is slightly over carbed that thins out the beer more than desired on the pallet. However, beer is still medium body. As this sits for 45+ mins, the carb starts to dissipates and leaves a more velvet mouth feel. 

Overall, excellently crafted barrel aged stout that showcases the use of great barrels and stout recipe. Unbelievable that this is non adjucted. I think the beer falls short on feel(but gets better once it sits open) but I would gladly drink another! I also do not think it is worth the price of admission, unless you are able to get it directly from the brewery.","Dec 13, 2020"

Juice Machine,,Washington,4.21/5,"16oz can courtesy of Roguer. No obvious canning date.

Poured into a Tree House snifter that accompanied the can, this was a murky, almost mottled orange-amber color, with a sudsy, beige colored head. Beer neglige-style lace.

Initially, big citrus aroma upon popping the can open. Before long there were also tropical fruit and melon aromas.

Citrusy, fruity and melon-y hop flavor, with the melon-like aspect slightly higher in the mix than the other aspects, but it's quite well balanced. Bitterness is fairly light, but that lack of assertive bitterness doesn't make the beer overly sweet or cloying as a consequence. Hides it's abv quite well, and is rather easy drinking.

16 fl. oz. can coded ""BE KIND 04/21/22 06:58:17"" and sampled on 05/20/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: Juice Machine is a double NEIPA at 8.2% ABV, It's poured a murky orange and gold body beneath a two finger thick head of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma suggests orange, mango, papaya, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is fuller, as usual, and offers up everything found in the nose along with additional notes of peach, some floral character, passionfruit, spiciness, a little bit of melon, zest of lime, some hop resins, and a touch of mint. The malt is sweetish and bready. A median bitterness balances it and it finishes dry with some hop resins and spiciness lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a lot of extra proteins but also with a little bit of zing from the acidic ""hop burn"". As usual for Treehouse the head has held up really well and there's a great amount of fancy lacing throughout the entire glass. I don't know if that's because of all the extra proteins or how carefully they're processing their beers (probably both) but they always have great head retention and lacing. This is my third can of Juice Machine and I've blown through them fairly quickly because although it's full of flavor and ""dank"", it's not as ""dank"" or intense as some of their other beers. They make a few NEIPAs that are even more accessible, and this is pretty complex so I'd put this somewhere in the middle range of what they do.

Juice Machine was a pseudo-whale for me for a while. For some reason I just could not get the timing right with my trips to Tree House and releases of this beer. Unfortunately, in the last half a decade or so since this debuted, Tree House has only become better at making beer. So it's not exactly mind-blowing compared to some newer offerings.

Juice Machine,,Tennessee,4.06/5,"7-week-old can poured into a tulip glass.

Beautiful Orange Julius body, golden-orange with a nice glow in the edges. Heavy haze but no murk. Nice fluffy head of bright white bubbles. Solid retention but excellent lacing. A few swirls brings back some nice, tight foam. Absolute looker like so many TH hazies. Pretty much everything you'd look for, looks-wise.

Complex nose, but the first takeaway is a combination of overripe stone fruit and a surprising booziness. Nice complementary notes of mango, guava, ripe pineapple, passion fruit, vanilla, and a wonderful dank weediness. Melon and berries late with maybe just a slight twang of the familiar TH Juicy Fruit gum yeast note, all of which is lovely. There's a starchy greeness on the nose that I really like, as the bright fruits mesh with it well. But man, much boozier than any other TH beer I can think of, though perhaps some of that is booze and some is the overripe fruit. It's definitely interesting!

Much drier and milder than I expected. Is this one different at less than a month in the can? Very juicy and grassy, but the fruit notes are fairly muddled and non-descript and the starchy greens kind of overwhelm everything else. It's incredibly drinkable, with almost no residual sweetness and a nice grapefruit pith bite late. But it's not nearly as nuanced and layered as a lot of other TH hazies I've had.

Creamy and soft and just a touch chewy (which I like), with TH's standard (and awesome) coating of the teeth and tongue, making for a very lasting pithy grapefruit vibe finish. A little alcohol heat on the back end and a touch of a green burn.

I was really excited to try this one given the brewery reputation and the beer description -- figured this was right up their alley. Very drinkable, but not a special beer like I was expecting.","Jan 27, 2022"

Impenetrably opaque liquid, the usual apricot juice appearance. The dankness in the nose is fresh an leafy while subordinate to pineapple, guava, green melon fruit scents, in turn the citrus gets lost in the mix, pine sap, whipped cream and raw oatmeal accents blend in, overall the aromas do not separate sufficiently to describe things in greater detail. This a full-bodied beer like drinking fruit puree and it's clear that is fully the intent. You almost have to consciously swallow to get it down. Quite sweet featuring green melon, mango, kiwi, guava flavors, nothing tart which would suggest pineapple. Little bit more oomph in the tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus. The malts add even more softness as well as cream of oats and vanilla flavors. The hops try but really don't bitter up the finish, just add some marijuana flavoring. This is a statement beer which fully meets its intended goals. (Canned 9/29/21)","Oct 25, 2021"

Very GGGreennn,,New Jersey,4.25/5,"Pours a perfect hazy orange-yellow color, very dense, perfect foamy head. Loads or orange citrus in the nose. Flavor is waves of citrus. Very sharp hop bite, despite being a month old. Very juicy, with a lasting hop bitterness, but not a west coast bitterness. Just an overly hopped bitterness. Perfect carbonation creates a creamy texture. Overall a very good DIPA, a little to bitter for me.

Very GGGreennn,,Colorado,4.32/5,"Pours a pale, translucent yellow; dirty yellow and cloudy in the glass; thick head; off-white, dense and spongy; semi-creamy texture; spidery fingers and webs of foam cling to the glass. Somewhat weak nose; green herbs, soft biscuit; indeterminate earthy esters. Smooth, grainy taste with a sublime bitter undercurrent; mild oat; zesty hop bitterness; very low-key earthy fruitiness, subliminal pineapple and grapefruit. Heavy body; smooth and velvety; semi-juicy; light to moderate dryness component.

Billed as 'An American Double IPA' on the label, this beer is nowhere near as intense in flavor or feel like so many others. Instead, there is a respectable balance and nuance at work. The drinkability of the beer if pretty phenomenal. There is nothing harsh or brash about the taste or mouthfeel, just glorious smooth and tasty vibes of the hazy-persuasion.

Very GGGreennn,,Washington,4.49/5,"16oz tallboy can courtesy of Roguer, unjustly neglected in my fridge til now. Bottom of can is stamped ""Vvvery Good"" and indicates it was canned on October 14, 2022. So, yeah, a 5 month old DNEIPA. Yes, I'm sad about it, too. 

Poured a murky, cloudy color that was a mixture of yellow and orange. Big, creamy, off-white head, lots of lace.

Big fruit forward hop nose that reminds one of guava and mango, orange and pineapple.

Taste is much like the aroma, and seems pretty sharp for having lingered for 5 months past it's canning. Fruity, citrusy and sweet up front, a little more bitter on the back end but the finish is a soft one.

Medium bodied, with a creamy, slightly oily mouthfeel.

In my defense, Roger hit me with an awful lot of fucking beer at once, so a lot of stuff that was hoppy had to find a place in the fridge quickly, resulting in a few cans getting shoved into corners not easily observable. Having said that, this doesn't seem to have been affected much at all by it, as it is still excellent.

Smells of straight-up pineapple juice-and powerful. Like you can smell it across the room powerful. Maybe a hint of oranges.

Taste follows. Pineapple/citrus up front then a nice grassy, rindy bitterness on the back end. Bit of juicy fruit gum throughout the sip.

T: More peach and mango up front, transitioning to more general citrus/tropical in the middle. Finishes with an exceptional dry bitterness that is just right.

F: The classic Tree House soft mouthfeel is on display here, with just enough prickliness at the end to keep the tastebuds alert.

O: A magnificent example of what a NEDIPA can be. An aroma that recalls the finest fruit produce at the farmer's market. A taste that's juicy without being thick or sweet. A feel that's pillowy but keeps you awake. It's all here.","Aug 26, 2022"

Canned: Aug-10-2022

Pours like they all do... Very nice, glowing orange haziness with a creamy cap that sticks around till the end. Aroma and flavor are a complex, layered mixture of tropical and non-tropical fruits and different ""green"" characters just like the OG Green (probably my favorite beer, and definitely my favorite NEIPA) but turned up a bit. This does not drink like a gimmick. Nose is still a little rough around the edges. But is a melange of sticky, resinous fruit. The flavor is grapefruit oleo, underripe guava, green mango, pine sap. It is so wonderfully sappy-yet-sweet and hop layered/laden. It reminds me of the first time I had Heady Topper*. Morning dew in the Rockies at the break of day after a late night around the campfire. Hot dogs. America. Fuck. So good.
Truly loverly.

For a second I thought I had Very Green in two different labels and wondered why this one tasted so much better. I brought back a couple of cases from my camping trip of all sorts of shades of Green. The sweet floral aroma out of the can translated right into the flavor and held strong the whole way through to the end of the can. That is rare. The malt backbone was just strong enough to hold it all together without getting in the way. Wow! I wish I had more.

Very GGGreennn,,Indiana,4.5/5,"This beer pours a beautiful, turbid pineapple color with a creamy oatmeal head that coats the glass all the way down. The nose features a significant dank citrus note, along with spicy passion fruit, mango, and pineapple aromas.

There’s dank citrus flavors up front on taste, but it’s that passion fruit/mango/pineapple trifecta that makes this beer for me, and the full, creamy mouthfeel that accompanies the bit of hop bite at the back end is just the cherry on top of this excellent beer.","Jun 24, 2022"
Very GGGreennn,,Connecticut,4.42/5,"Canned on 6/2/22; consumed on 6/17/22

Pours a turbid, mango purée-esque body topped with multiple fingers of rich, fluffy, slightly off-white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and thin, soapy curtains of webby/spotty lacing draping down the entirety of the walls of the glass.

Aromas of dank peppermint beneath layers of juicy pineapple and mango slices dominant, with dense undertones of bubblegum yeast accented by papaya as a subtle, bready malt welcomes an earthy, catty stank to the back end of the bouquet.

Taste highlights orange contrasted by sweeter peach upfront, progressively dank and overripe into musty passionfruit and guava over the mid-palate as a catty dank proceeds into bready malt easing into mossy undertones on the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body and a moderate carbonation, rounded and fluffy to a peak of creamy overtones and contrasting juicy, boggy resins; a hop twang emerging in the back end guides to a refined, earthy grit marking the finish.

Myriad juicy fruits and boggy hops bring an onslaught of lush, full-flavored character within an overtly resinous containment; supremely, comprehensively expressive, this is an immense display of hop variation from Tree House at its peak.","Jun 18, 2022"

M: Light bodied, crisp and fizzy, with medium-high carbonation. Mouth watering quality.

Westly,,Ohio,4.3/5,"Foggy orange, appearing slightly lighter around the edges, with a short but persistent fuzzy blanket ridged at the collar with one long arm of lace reaching around half the glass.

Unexpectedly, this features more wood and funk than fruit. It's quite mature, nutty, oaky and even dusty, with notes of cashew and walnut. At the same time, it's quite sour of white wine, apricots, green grape, lemon and mango vinegar (while at the same time avoiding acetic harshness). The moderate body has a soft then crispening fizz before coming to a semi-dry finish.

While I was slightly underwhelmed by West Ashley, this is a marked improvement, and really in and of itself a fantastic saison. However, (while qualifying ahead of time that SARA has nothing to prove), for a saison showcasing a stone fruit such as apricot, it doesn't quite reach the heights of some of the greats. Fou Foune is already a tall hill to overcome, but even further, for me personally, de Garde is the king of the stone fruits, and just tower over everyone else.","Nov 12, 2019"

Westly,,New York,4.49/5,"This one pours a hazy bright orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like vibrantly sour apricot, citrus, ripe fruit, oak, loads of sour white wine.

The apricot flavor just bursts forward here - with tongue-tingling sourness and drippy juiciness - it's so authentic and wonderful tasting. There's a lot of barrel too, wine slathered all over it, with some mildly tempering oak as well. There's also a sort of general sour citrus character, as well.

This is light bodied, and pretty high on the sour scale - personally, maybe an 8/10. It's still pretty drinkable despite that.

I'm not 100% sure this is better than regular 'ol West Ashley. Nonetheless, it's still a really special beer.","Oct 01, 2019"

Westly,,Germany,3.74/5,"Pours a clouded amber-orange color, with a froth, stable head.

Smells of yogurt, orange sorbet and fresh cut apricots. Got a unique funk profile to it, which leads to a apricot stone pit quality among wet earth and moldy wood. While this is pretty fruit centered, it leaves enough space on the palate for the funk to play an important role on the aromas, as it sets the state of the fruits somewhere between wet and juicy.

Has a soft, lighter mouthfeel, with a well nuanced, sparkly effervescence during the beers finish. 

Tastes of an initial bread dough softness, which turns more mineralic, once the carbonation becomes recognizable, which also brings the fruits to the palate. Turns quite acidic then, making the beer utmost sour with an almost calming presence of unripe apricots. The apricots take a sweet turn then, developing a sudden, utmost pleasant ripeness, which blends perfectly into cream cheese and leather. Develops a late yogurt funk note with a sparkly rock licking impression, turning the fruits a little younger again, with a late, funky sourness. 

This is solid with a slightly more pronounced fruity- and sourness. Lacks depth apart from that, while its sourness is too pronounced.","Jul 26, 2018"
Westly,,Rhode Island,4.74/5,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adarius tulip glass. Drank right after tasting West Ashley Thanks Jake for the trade.

On the nose, it’s very fruit-forward and champagne-like. Tons of stone fruit aromas, very juicy and potent. Psyched to taste this based on the nose!

On the tongue, it’s very tart upfront but the fruit is delicate and balanced. Just enough apricot flavors. Very juicy and crisp, lightly funky, champagne, white wine flavors. Oak barrel flavors show up slightly on the follow through. Mouthfeel is spot on with refreshing, medium-high carbonation.

I wasn't floored by this one, especially considering the hype behind it, but I had a few other beers this night that kind of trounced IWAAD. The complexity was lacking, and so too was the pastry decadence--I figured there'd at least be an explosion of one or the other.

It Was All A Dream,,Illinois,4.74/5,"Batch 2
Pours pitch black, glugs out of the bottle. Thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Coconut fat floaters. The nose is just insane, coffee roast, sweet marshmallow, coconut, smoky oak, bourbon, sweet maple. Taste is a layered dessert. Chocolate cake, smoke, roasted coffee beans, vanilla icing, sweet toasted coconut, spicy bourbon, maple comes across subtlety in the background. Mouthfeel is full bodied, sticky, coats your mouth. Overall, what more can be said, the adjuncts just play so well off of each other here, and some how come together perfectly. This beer is well worth the cost of admission. Phenomenal!","Jun 09, 2018"

F: Thick and syrupy motor oil - sticks to your mouth

look - pitch black, surprising 1/2 finger light tan head, tons of lacing, absolutely coating the sides of the glass and just stopping on the sides of the glass barely sliding down

smell - tons of coconut and maple in the nose, barrel and chocolate and vanilla and way behind in the race, bold and lovely

taste - barrel pops through a ton but maple and coconut holding strong. bitter dark chocolate coming through more and more with the vanilla still trailing a lot. Not a ton of vanilla. This is really incredible. Uniquely balanced. Bold and exquisite

Perfectly balanced, with just enough caramelly malt sweetness to provide structure while allowing the hoppy goodness to shine through. Big flavors of pine, orange, and grapefruit, with a floral note and lots of resiny bitterness.

T: very good west coast hop profile with a solid grapefruit bitterness but not so aggressive that it becomes fatigued. Malt is light and appropriate. 

M: body is medium light with a slight dryness and no cloying sweetness. Very nice finish with a hint of ultimate slickness that just works.

Pliny The Elder,,District of Columbia,5/5,"To me this beer is perfection. The key to success here is the undeniable malty foundation. With such a sturdy base the high floral and bittering notes of the hops really stand out as contrast and the entire sip becomes a journey.

Pliny The Elder,,Minnesota,4.76/5,"510ml bottle. Label is stamped with the bottling date of '111822'. Purchased at the taproom store.
Nearly clear, light pale gold colored body. Two fingers of puffy white head. Leaves some scattered webs of lacing.
Aroma, as described, is intense with pine, citrus (more orange and tangerine than grapefruit), and floral (aromatic).
Taste is initially sweet with citrus (again orange and tangerine), then comes the bitterness of the pine. Also has a floral expression. Very full of flavors. Aftertaste is more of an afterglow of the original flavors, with some vegetal hops lingering as long as one may want to wait before taking another sip. 
Fuller mouth feel. Has a soft texture. Very good carbonation.
Very well balanced with the malts and hops. Such a good mix of nose and flavors among the citrus, pine, and floral components. Definitely is a Goldilocks beer, and one that I would prefer more than most NEIPAs. This is because there is more bitterness here, which balances so well with the sweet and floral notes. Also the Santa Rosa taproom is so mellow and energetic at the same time, with that certain Sonoma vibe.","Dec 23, 2022"
Pliny The Elder,,Minnesota,4.45/5,"Fairly clear golden pour with a 1 finger white head. Decent retention and some lacing on the glass.

There is no strange flavors like dank, mango, or any other gimmicks in this beer.

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),,,4.63/5,"Bottled on 9/25/19, consumed on 6/27/23. Served and consumed starting at 45 F and warming to close to room temperature.

Look: Deep, dark brown, almost (but not quite) black. Thin chocolate colored head, but more than I expected for a four year old bottle.

Smell: Maple and chocolate and immediately obvious, with noticeable bourbon as well. Little to no coffee.

Taste: The strong maple sweetness and the bourbon are noticeable first. Some chocolate is there, but very little coffee except for some bitterness in the aftertaste. The lack of an overwhelming coffee taste works well here, as it lets the maple and bourbon shine but provides just enough bitterness to offset the maple sweetness.

Feel: Silky and smooth with a moderate bite on the back end. The 11.3% ABV is more noticeable in the feel that the taste. Warmth and a mild sting from the alcohol are both present, but not in overwhelming amounts.

Overall: this is a world-class beer for good reasons. This is my very last bottle, so unless Founders re-releases it in the future I'll just say CBS will forever be one of the absolute best barrel aged stouts I have ever had the pleasure of sampling.","Jun 27, 2023"

Met with maple as soon as I opened the cap, and it's still the dominant note, though there is some very slight bourbon. 4.5

Big maple and chocolate, just a minor hint of coffee. Touch of char and barrel, maybe slight leather. 4.5

Body is wicked smooth with zero sign of how big and burly this beer is. Slight warming blossom as it went down. 11.3% is non-existent- even halfway through the bottle. Dangerous! 5

Glass: Snifter
ABV: 11.3%
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy light brown head. The head slowly dissipates to a thick ring and thin cover. Lacing is excellent.

Smell: 
A fairly sweet nose. Semi-sweet chocolate. Some brown sugar and maple syrup. Light notes of vanilla. Faint ones of coffee. A touch of bourbon.

Taste: 
Follows the nose but with the maple and the sweetness much more pronounced. And the bourbon notes. The coffee cannot be noticed until fairly late in the sip. The alcohol is noticeable and provides a bit of a sting at the end along with warmth.

Feel: 
Smooth, silky and mouth-coating. Very noticeable warmth and a sting from the alcohol. The body is medium-full.

Overall: 
A very nice Imperial Stout. Complex. This brew is definitely sweet, which makes it a dessert beer for me.

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),,Florida,4.33/5,"2019 bomber, poured at 53° into a Founders Brewing sniffer.
Age said no head, so this pours flat black with just a whisper of beige foam that ghosted out fast.
Awesome room-filling aroma of fresh pulled espresso, a chocolatiers best offering in his shop, quite light bourbon too.
Bold flavor - but god awful sweet - tastes of dark chocolate covered coffee beans, vanilla, maple syrup, a bit of mild tobacco. Finishes short with barrel and maple leaf candy left on the palate. Burp of coffee. Sticky lip.
Thick. Really thick. Almost no carbonation at all.

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),,Ohio,2.61/5,"Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed.

Bottled 10/9/2019, poured into a snifter. Great stout appearance, with inky black color and tan lacing that settles into a consistent ring around the glass. Smell is of mocha, coffee and maple, with light bourbon. A great blend of aromas. Lovely taste that balances all of the aroma components. The bourbon is just right in that doesnt dominate the other tastes. Mouthfeel is typical of a first rate stout.

---

On the evening of March 10th, 2023, I had the pleasure of enjoying a batch 2 bottle thanks to the contrite generosity of a long lost friend, ultimately coming away enjoying it even more than b4. 

Here, an oaky funk pairs with an impressive array of stonefruits and pear accompanied by a beautiful bouquet of herbal accents, including a hint of spearmint, making for an absurdly unique yet ever delicate expression. Unlike b4, I do actually feel that I perceive the faintest hint of buckwheat here, which provides a satisfying comfort in a small but substantial way.

This beer exhibits such unbelievable balance and complexity that it may be their best barrel aged saison, and I find myself increasing my already very high score of 4.76.","Dec 05, 2022"
Samuel,,Idaho,4.25/5,"750ml bottle at share. Cloudy golden pour with a thin white foamy head. Tart, musty aroma, grassy. Taste is a bit of farmhouse funk, sweet, fruity, grassy.","Sep 28, 2022"
Samuel,,Massachusetts,4.61/5,"Finally cracking this bottle after getting it in one of the HF home delivery programs many months ago. Pours less billowy than many of the HF offerings, with little head retention or lacing to speak of. This is a superbly well-rounded and nuanced offering, with all of the characteristics of a rustic saison, a fine effervescent white wine, and a barrel aged sour all-in-one, with no one attribute dominating the others. $60/750ml is very high, but this is barely over into 'worth it' territory

Samuel,,Florida,4.23/5,"Bottle. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Mild vinous bouquet. Good stuff. Wine barrel gives way to tasty farmhouse notes. Not crazily complex but so solid, clean, and refreshing. A over average body and mouthfeel.","May 15, 2022"
Samuel,,New York,5/5,"This one pours a golden and bright orange color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like hay, minerally funk, lemon candy, grassy funk, honey, oak, white wine, grape, sweet floral funk, and pear skin.

This is absolutely phenomenal, and represents the best of what Hill Farmstead is capable of. The recipe appears to be a cross of two of my favorite beers that Hill Farmstead has ever done - Vera Mae and Le Sarrasin - so this beer has been on my list for a while now. It's got this wonderfully fresh and lemony taste to it, like funky lemon candy, with that rustic funk - pear, citrus, grassy, a little bit of herbal and mineral character, along with lots of oak spice. There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor.

This is light bodied, effervescent, and very drinkable. Taking down an entire 750 of this one would be absolutely no problem.

This is in the top 3 of all Hill Farmstead beers I've ever had, and it's maybe even the best beer overall that I've ever had. It's honestly perfect.","Apr 21, 2022"
Samuel,,Massachusetts,5/5,Have had this several times. One of hills best,"Jan 28, 2022"
Samuel,,Illinois,4.6/5,"Original release bottle; drank 6/26/21 @ the Seventh Tee. 

The nose was like a fine, elegant white wine with farmyard funk; the flavor had a bit more sourness, but was never puckering. 

A wonderful mix of European and American wild notes; this is a special beer.","Jun 28, 2021"
Samuel,,Florida,4.34/5,"750 mL bottle. Lightly cloudy golden. Smells of strong white wine, honey, and sweet florals. Tastes of honey, white wine, and florals. Pleasant light tartness. Faint herbal and earthy yeast flavors in the background. Medium body. Soft malt profile. Excellent all around. I don't know that it's miles better than their other BA saisons, but this is really nice.","Mar 14, 2021"
Samuel,,Maine,4.55/5,"Batch 2 - consumed 02/05/21 - split with jrc1093

Pours a straw yellow colour - clear, with a slight particle fog, and a bright eggshell white head that stays around, bubbly, and leaving spotty lacing behind. Visible effervescence.

Nose: Ultra-clean, rustic dusty grain emerges beneath a bright, vibrant lemon, wet hay, straw, green apple - a bit of hyacinth floral flower pedal, with some hearty grain character underneath. Vinous influence is evident, but tucked in, not surrounding. There's a deep, musty funk element that grips ahold, charging through the delicate base with wet dead leaves, petrichor, wet stone, and a big funky wet green pasture note, complete with the resident cows.

Palate: Bright vibrant acidity opens up with twisted lemon and a sweaty brett tang - sharper on the Hill Farmstead acidity scale, but friendly and never aggressive. Dusty cracked grain and a subtle interwoven honey sweetness lay beneath a rapidly evolving symphonic display of barnyard funk complexity - horseblanket, wet hay, limestone minerality, aged honeycomb, and a panoply of complex musty earthy tones spiral together, reaching a singularity of bold, almost concentrated funk character, highlighting that robust, slight savoury quality - speared by shimmering bright lemon and lime zest, Asian pear, green apple, apricot, and dry, fruity, and floral white vinous character. Dry tannic oak envelops the funk, subduing the brighter notes, and reaching a dry, but colourful finish with lingering white grape, grain, and an oily, citrus pith bitterness that persistently whispers in the background. 


Mouthfeel/Body: Samuel is crisp, bright, and composed, with an underlying roundness that leads to something between light and medium-bodied. The sheer robust saturation alone contributes presence. Acidity is tightening, but neither puckering nor very dry, with an inherent wetness about it. Effervescence is fine, ample, and spritzy, while the finish sees an oily cling so persistent, it's nearly waxy.

Overall: Samuel seems to stand at the pinnacle of its niche. With a depth of funky complexity and a seemingly endless revelation of layers all seamlessly knit together in perfect harmony, it really does lend an almost lambic element to the junction of old world and new world saison. It's a beautiful beer, and one I feel privileged to have shared and enjoyed.","Feb 07, 2021"
Samuel,,Connecticut,4.43/5,"Bottled on 4/23/19; consumed on 2/5/21

Pours a lightly fogged, pale honey gold body sporting a steady stream of soft effervescence and capped with a briefly-formed quarter-finger of plush, eggshell-white foam; a paper-thin island of cap, moderate, creamy collar, and haphazard display of dense, webby/spotty lacing remains.

Aroma is initially brightly horsey, a musty lemon acidity contrasting orange oil-imbued lavender perfume into rounded, delicately lactic funk; a touch of white grape and evocative nuances of farmland pasture peak into floral spice and an almost savory, dusty, worn leather over the middle; spent vanillin tones evolve into honey in waves on the back end, with stone cellar, wet buckwheat and full-bodied grains supplementing tones of finished leather, honey, and a clean minerality surging through the close.

Taste opens with a lemony funk sporting a tinge of horse blanket, with honey and tangerine impressing a distant sweetness before a grassy tone overtakes the mid-palate; petrichor shapes notes of damp stone cellar, dusty, old leather, green apple, and wet grains on the back end and through the finish.

Mouthfeel features a body just shy of medium displaying a texture uniquely wet though quickly tightening to a seamless acidity; semi-chalky grit phases into a moderate tartness juxtaposed by a casual, background bitterness over the mid-palate, while the back end of the palate displays oily, nearly waxy characteristics into the back end, peaking with a brightness past the finish.

Beginning with the allure of attenuated funk, a revelatory depth emerges, peeling back layers to the most evocative heart of the style; fruits, herbs, minerals: a biome of natural senses interplay in an almost unrivaled fashion.","Feb 05, 2021"
Samuel,,Massachusetts,4.5/5,"Bottle. Pours pretty like every one of the Hill Farmstead sour saisons. Hazy glowing yellow and a big, fluffy head. Aroma is tart and layered. Flavor was very well rounded and tart. I love the level of sourness and they finish so clean. Great beer.","Dec 06, 2020"
Samuel,,Massachusetts,4.93/5,"The beer pours a clear straw yellow with a thin fizzy head. It’s highly carbonated with lime zest, minerals, musty funk, subtle wine, with a bone dry finish. Excellent beer.","Apr 11, 2020"

Samuel,,Montana,4.86/5,"I've had wine barrel vera mae once before and I'd say that's a really good comparison to this beer. Basically a perfect mixed culture barrel aged saison. Lemon and honey shine through in the taste and it finishes super smooth and dry, not acidic at all. Really outstanding.","Nov 02, 2019"
Samuel,,District of Columbia,4.61/5,Bottle pour at Hill Farmstead.,"Aug 02, 2019"
Samuel,,Oregon,4.59/5,"Four bottles consumed on-site at Hill Farmstead Brewery throughout the course of the same day during the anniversary week, May 22, 2019. Served in a stemmed glass.

I'll note that our servers had variable ways of pouring the beer. Shaun Hill himself refused to pour any sediment, leaving it at the bottom of the bottle. Other staff would pour the sediment into each glass. This review is essentially going to focus on the non-sedimented pour, which is supposedly what Shaun Hill wants us to experience- but I'll put in a few notes about differences. Read on- 

Appearance- the difference in pour clarity is astounding. First pour from Shaun is golden yellow body, good clarity, one finger frothy white head, good retention, bit of lacing that sticks around for a good while. Other pours were more cloudy and hazy, having more of a peach coloured body. Pretty astounding, wish I could upload photos for my review to show you guys the difference.

Aroma- Clear pour was relatively clean. Mild-moderate acetone, light leather, stonefruit, mild damp oak funk, vanillin, light green apple, white vinous character. It is as every bit aggressive as Tete de Cuvee 2016. Rich, full-barrel aroma. The sedimentous pours provided a bigger fruity presence, light apricot flavours adding more tartness. Hard to argue with either method here.

Flavour- Clear pour was an absolute delight- light green apple and moderate acetone, vanillin, moderate acetic acidity, light grainy funk, oak, touch of biscuit, dry white vinous character along with a mild apricot stonefruit tart flavour. Lots of complexity to it, slightly dry and more crisp acetic acidity compared to the sedimentous pour which provided more of a moderate stonefruit flavour to it, a bit more minerality to it. I can see why Shaun prefers this to be poured clear- it has a more discrete presence of flavour to it, a crisper and drier expression of stonefruit and barrel. The sedimentous pour was a bit more muddled, while it bought a bit more stonefruit to the table, it also blurred the remainder of the beer somewhat. That being said, a separate pour of the dregs at the bottom of the bottle did taste pretty amazing.

Mouthfeel- medium bodied, crisp and just a trace bit of acetone dryness on the palate. Good carbonation. It was easy to both sip and aggressively drink down my multiple glasses. This is certainly a beer to take a moment of and consider, but also to enjoy. I figure that's what the brewer's vision for it is.

Overall- A fairly impressive barrel-aged saison which I think is distinguished by its relatively forward barrel character with vanillin and acetone. In my opinion, this compares very closely to Side Project's offering- Tete de Cuvee- which sports a similar oak-forward acetone character to it. I doubt I'll ever be able to do a side-by-side, but in my memory, they are pretty close.","May 24, 2019"
Samuel,,New York,4.74/5,"Onsite pour, half of bottle into HF goblet.

Bright straw color, foamy full off white head. Sticky lacing covers the glass.

Aroma is grassy, citrus zest and oaky eart with a hint of funk.
Flavor has crackers grain, tart, slightly sweet, earthy grass and hay. 
Some fruity flavors including light grape and floral berry.
Everything is balanced and clean, dry, nothing over powering.
An excellent and exciting brew.","May 22, 2019"
Samuel,,Illinois,4.61/5,"750ml bottle, dated December 12, 2017, poured into a gray Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.

The beer pours a hazy lemon color, golden hues with a thin white head, hardly any retention with a few spots of lace clinging to the glass. The aroma is excellent, super funky, lots of earthy and grassy qualities, strong buckwheat and pale cereal grains, dead leaves, pine resin, musty oak, light vinous acidity, citrus peel and a bit of vanilla. The flavors are fantastic, super dry and grassy, limestone, citrus peel, cereal grains that are softer and sweeter with some heartier flax and buckwheat grain, musty oak, light char, vanilla and white grain. The mouthfeel is good, lively and crisp, vibrant texture with a medium body that finishes easily with a tart bite. 


Verdict: An excellent saison, complex, bright, balanced with an incredible funk profile. The wine profile is wonderful, layered perfectly, just a great beer.","Mar 16, 2019"
Samuel,,Massachusetts,5/5,"appearance is a glowing straw color with dense and creamy bright white head. aroma is so wine forward, huge white grape, tannins and oak, bright fruity acidity of green apple peach skin, and lemon, complimented by scents of hay, mellow earthy funk. palate follows the nose but with extreme complexity bringing huge vinous notes, gape flesh and musty grape skin, tanic quality, oaky character hinting at vanilla, incredibly bright and crisp fruity character, hay and some mellow barnyard qualities, grainy bread, tart apple, and lemon throughout. insanely dry, delicate, and crisp. overall this is beyond words really, the best beer ive ever tasted, and by quite a margin. 5+++","Feb 22, 2019"
Abner,,North Carolina,4.59/5,"Such a well balanced beer. Hill Farmstead doesn't go crazy with one flavor profile and that is embodied here. While labeled a NE IPA, is more caramel colored than hazy and tastes blend west coast and east coast styles, similar to Focal Banger. Definitely hoppy at the start but mellows with a malty, oaty finish. Partly hoppy and partly rustic, Abner is a expertly minimalist IPA. They do all the little things right.","Jun 04, 2023"
Abner,,Virginia,4.34/5,"A really great double IPA! Had a pint at The Bench restaurant in Stowe VT. Pours a hazy orange color with a good size white head and good lacing on the glass. Mostly citrus aroma but nicely balanced with hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is rich, crisp and moderately bitter. An outstanding Double IPA!!","Jun 02, 2022"
Abner,,,4.61/5,Definitely a double. The alcohol flavor is produced more so than other hill farmstead beers. However the beer is truly a HF beer with the deep caramel hue and succinct crisp hoppiness that is so refined. Amazing beer but I prefer a lower alcohol beer.,"May 19, 2022"
Abner,,Germany,4.69/5,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.

Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.

Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.

Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable.

Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder. Great beer that once again demonstrates the versatility of Hill Farmstead brewing high quality stuff from different styles.","May 04, 2022"
Abner,,Massachusetts,4.48/5,"Draft at Armsby Abbey

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this

Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind

It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced

Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more","Apr 06, 2022"
Abner,,Virginia,4.5/5,"Had on tap. Pours a mostly clear light orange. Nice white head leaves a solid lace curtain. Smell and taste are fruity, with a little pine. Just an extremely well-crafted IIPA. Excellent.","Apr 06, 2022"
Abner,,Kiribati,3.55/5,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, from his massive NBS BIF # 15 hit. 16oz can (dated 8/18/20) poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a solid medium-dark orange color with a bit more than a half-inch of white head that had good retention and lacing.

A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence. 

Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well.

The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light.

Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.

Overall, even though almost certainly faded, this still a really nice beer. Would like to try it fresh some time. Worth grabbing if you see it.","Apr 05, 2022"
Abner,,Washington,4.26/5,"can into glass
Bought at brewery, canned 12 days prior.
Brief, white head. Cloudy, medium orange, with a bit of amber on the side of the glass. Candied tangelo peel, mango, a touch of allspice and light caramelized malt, makes up the aroma. First ⅔ of taste is very good, with a candied tangerine peel, some mango and off-dry ( a wine term for nearly a complete lack of sweetness ), medium toasted, caramelized malts. As soon as these flavors fade, a sharp tangerine peel bite comes in and crowds out all else, for a long finish.","Nov 13, 2021"
Abner,,Indiana,4.51/5,"Appearance - The beer was bright yellow in color with a bubbly white head that left generous lacing. 

Smell - The nose was a bouquet of fresh lemons surrounded by dankness. 

Taste - Initially, fresh but dry lemons led the profile. There was just a touch of sweetness like the East Coast style, but it was not liquid candy. The dankness really came through in the finish. 

Mouthfeel - The body was nicely thick with an almost gritty body. Carbonation somehow survived the viscosity. 

Overall - This is a great IPA, but I have had better.","Aug 28, 2021"

It says to drink by 6/8/21, so is this almost old?! Either way, it’s still fantastic. It looks, smells, and feels world class. It’s one of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had in a really long time. I would have guessed this is a 6.5% abv and not 8.2%. I love the bitterness throughout. Not West Coast style, but East Coast hazy like.

M: Properly crisp and smooth, but like a lot of HF I get a phlegmy feel which keeps the flavor and I love for beers like this 

O: This is an exceptional beer that makes me disappointed I have to drink other NE IPAs that are not Hill Farmstead. I would gladly drink this daily. This actually got better when paired with food too.","Dec 31, 2020"
Abner,,New York,4.63/5,"Poured from a can (08Dec2020) into a Teku

L: pours an opaque not creamy darker yellow orange with a very thick and dense white head. Slowly fades leaving very chunky lacing, nice foam on top of the beer ~30 minutes post pour

S: great fruit-forward note with piney hop bitterness to match. Avoids being overly sweet despite the quite tropical aroma, mix of mango/peach/melon with that more west coast piney bitterness adding some complexity

T: follows the nose well, with a mix of tropical flavors with a slightly piney/citrusy bitterness. Get that mango/peach/melon flavor from the nose, fully and slightly sweet but far from cloying. That bitterness follows quickly and carries through the medium/long finish. It’s just so easy to follow one sip with the next it’s amazing - doesn’t get old, feel heavy, get sweet

Abner,,Illinois,4.71/5,"I tend to be the kind of person who ends up underwhelmed by the beers that end up on the top 250 list ... especially when they're IPAs. But every once in a while, I try one that not only completely lives up to the hype, but surpasses it - Abner is one of those beers. 

Pours a cloudy, opaque, but bright orange color. Three finger frothy white head slowly dissipates leaving just a splotch of foam on top of the beer with a ring of white foam along the outside of the beer. Sparse white lacing coats the glass as the beer is consumed.

The aroma on this is incredible. Sweet and fruity without being too ""juicy"". Undertones of dried pine needles and grassy hops peep between notes of orange, tangerine, peach and mango. 

The taste follows the nose with notes of sweet orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple given way to a mild piney bitterness on the finish. There is a certain sweetness to it, but its very mild and balanced. The bitterness on the back end, kind of build on itself resulting in an overarching lingering bitterness on the palate. 

Feel is pretty light for a DIPA, Very smooth with bright, vibrant carbonation. 

Overall an absolutely stellar DIPA and worthy of its hyped billing.","Sep 07, 2020"
Abner,,Indiana,4.75/5,"A beautiful hazy golden orange color, the head is nearly perfect - a pearl white color, really dense and foamy, it literally creates a lace wall down the glass. Never seen anything like it.

The nose is dank tropical aromas, especially grapefruit, pineapple, mango - and also some pine. Wow. I didn’t see that coming.

The grapefruit is prominent on the taste, and it has a candied element that is absolutely magnificent. There’s also pineapple, mango, and the aforementioned pine. Perfectly balanced, with no hint whatsoever of the 8% ABV, this is an example of a brewery confident in their prowess with hops.

The mouthfeel is really dry and substantial, as expected. What a treat this beer is. If you look in the “IPA Hall Of Fame,” this beer is one of the original inductees, IMHO.","Sep 05, 2020"
Abner,,Washington,4.44/5,"Truly excited to finally get to try this legend!

Poured from 16oz can into stemless tulip. Straw colored, slightly transparent haze. Slight dank bitterness with undertones of stone/tropical fruit on the nose. Taste/mouthfeel are soft on the front of the palate - goes down with just a bit of a bite of bitterness. Somewhat juicy.

Overall - this one didn't disappoint! The softness/juiciness backed by the slight bitterness is the perfect marriage of east coast/west coast styles.","Sep 04, 2020"

Abner,,New Jersey,4.35/5,"Pour like most cloudier ipas but it isn’t murky at all, which is nice.

Taste follows same, sweeter citrus tangerine, Clementine, sweeter orange (cara cara, if you haven’t tried one do it you’ll thank me.) It finishes with a grapefruit bite. What separates this beer from other hazy beers is that it is not thick and cloying or heavy at all. It finishes pretty dry too and has a soft bitterness that is very pleasant and goes well with it.

Framboise Du Fermier,,Massachusetts,4.33/5,"Interesting plum-hued body with a bit of haze and a sudsy off-white head produced with moderate pour. Overripe raspberry billows out of the glass, with additional aromatics of fruit leather, champagne, and wildflowers. Very lovely although not particularly complex. Flavors lean tart, as per usual with SP, although the intense raspberry really helps balance things out here. Kinda like eating a raspberry with a lot of seeds, resulting in a more tart, tannic character. Feel is light, astringent and puckering.

Stone, grass, and grapefruit round out each sip. It's sweet, then tart. Mouth feel is creamy with a mild silt throughout. Thickness is medium-thick, coming in on the more full side of saisons.

Framboise Du Fermier,,Ohio,3.71/5,"Pale salmon-amber with almost no head that builds, resulting in a thin ring around the edge.

Not intending to start this off exactly like another review a few lines down, but this b2 FdF is way too sour. It's almost vinegary. An acetic, blackened oak overpowers the seedy raspberry, which is not as present as I'd expected. The finely carbonated medium body has also got a lemon juice sting to the dry finish. 

Definitely a huge disappointment, particularly considering it's position on the Top 250.","Jul 06, 2020"

Framboise Du Fermier,,Colorado,4.46/5,"while the side project wild beers have certainly been tending more acidic over the least year or so, in some instances, i think the higher acidity really works, and this is a great example of that. another one of the fruited fermier beers, up there with my favorites in the series, the plum, the cherry, and the blueberry, and i think the clean sourness that ramps up towards the end is part of what makes it. there is a lot of fruit in here, and a serious jammy sweetness is contributed by the raspberries, so the sour almost works to enhance and balance it, and with all the oak this has on it, along with the lemony funk, the drying cereal grain base, and the obvious maturity, its a complex and balanced brew that delivers what it seems to promise. i am not sure if this was aged in wine barrels or not, but it sure seems like it was, some notes of red and black currant in here, a tart cherry thing, and even a light strawberry thing, they all make it seem vinous to me, so does all the tannins in here. i even get trace watermelon flesh, juicy fruit gum, and red wine vinegar. suffice it to say there is quite a bit of depth to this. the fruit is insanely natural, really forward, and expressed beautifully through this base saison. almost as intense as i remember them being in the raspe, although i know this has to be less per barrel right? i also like it being a little stronger here, seems to slow me down, allow it to warm and open, and cut some of the flavor intensity with a little palate clearing alcohol. brilliant stuff, good carbonation too, especially compared to a few of the others in the series. the beat goes on for side project!","Nov 02, 2018"

Nice raspberry funk on the nose. An initial raspberry flavor hits the palate, but for some strange reason quickly fades as my acidic ""woo"" reaction kicks in. I've read so many reviews here with the same ""jam/jammy"" comments, and I was very disappointed when I finally got to try this coveted brew, because those 2 words are far from the truth. Jam is sweet, something you put on bread(or crackers if you really want to be Mr. Fancy Pants). This beer is strongly acidic, dare I say overly so.","Aug 21, 2018"

Double Sunshine,,Maryland,4.69/5,"Poured from the can into a Lawson's branded tulip/goblet glass. Canned April 26th 2023.

Beamin juicy orange colored body, with a touch of haze and light visible carbonation. Three finger forming head, a bit of soapy and big bubbled appearance which pops easily, with light retention. Still manages to stick around and leave a tall collar as well, making a nice crowned appearance.

Delicious aroma. Hop pressing front nose with light citrus, and faint touching juicy tropical notes. A nice creamy touch almost sweet vanilla, mixing with a light caramel and crispy malt quality. Comes off like hinting of light powdered sugar on fruity pancakes quality.

The mouthfeel on this is just unreal. An intense solid backbone that is creamy with just a light touch of pushing sweet tones on the palate. The mid hits with thick THICK controlled orange and pine notes, mixing sweet cream and orange, and pine/earth heat. Bitterness comes in the finish, so ever slowly, with first notes of tangerine and Christmas spices, then with lingering notes of pepper and wood bitterness. Campfire like warmth in the back palate, that just slowly sits and churns with all the orange and spices you can imagine.

Fantastic IPA, and hardly any hint of big abv now that I think of it. Just killer stuff.","Jun 27, 2023"
Double Sunshine,,New York,4.85/5,"This stuff is an absolute treat!

L: Pours a deep golden, yet clear in the glass. Fluffy, white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session.

S: Smells of grapefruit, citrus, dank hops, and sweet bread malt.

T: Grapefruit and sweet malt dominates the beginning, the hops come into play by this point and play very nicely with the grapefruit. These dank, citusy notes do not overpower and keep the beer tasting fresh. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA.

F: Nice level of carbonation, feels smooth and finishes clean. Incredibly drinkable for a session. Just be careful with DIPAs with this level of drinkability.

O: Incredibly well balanced DIPA with an excellent flavor profile. This might be my favorite DIPA I have tried to date.","Mar 09, 2023"
Double Sunshine,,New York,4.02/5,A little disappointing. Overall a solid IPA but just expected better after having Sips of Sunshine. Surprised at the perfect 100 rating.

Double Sunshine,,Kentucky,4.7/5,"Every super hero has a skill, they have a talent, they have a gift. They have the ability to do something that no one else can do and they use it for good. Lawson's finest has a gift for hops and they do good bringing a double dose of their best efforts to the New England craft beer community.

Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance. Looking the part of most hazy ale, the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe, roaring and racy tone. Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart, the early palate is met with cereal, honey, caramel and cream.

As the malts settle on the palate, the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branch-ripe Valencia orange, tangerine, mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors. Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and push-ups. Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine, fragrant woods, citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite.

Medium-full in body, the beer's bold flavors and creamy upstart finishes remarkably dry and resinous. A long but smooth bitterness is lasting with fruit peels and herb for a session that's classically hazy up front and traditionally bitter to finish- a best of both worlds.","Sep 16, 2022"
Double Sunshine,,Tennessee,4.37/5,"Canned 8/10/22.

L: Pours a clear orange gold with a big creamy white head that thins on top but sticks around the glass. Lacing is splotchy and irregular but pretty.

S: Surprising juicy fruit aroma, more similar to Sip than expected. A touch of grapefruit and herb.

T: More juicy fruit up front, pivoting to grapefruit in the middle, with a dry and slightly bitter finish. No heat.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation.

O: Combines some of the best elements of new school juiciness and old school clarity and bitterness. Well crafted.","Aug 26, 2022"

Double Sunshine,,Massachusetts,4.36/5,"Pours a lightly hazy reddish golden with soapy white head. Some overripe mango and expressed grapefruit peel on the nose. A touch of mango but mostly citrus forward. Grapefruit is the central flavor that comes to mind. It's sticky, sappy, chewy. The chewiness of this is really what I'm enjoying the most. I remember this being much more tropical and less citrus forward when I had had it before but those are blurry memories from beer festivals and my palate memory is much more developed now than it was at that time.

Drier than the smell. The body leans rich but the carbonation is also elevated. The hop bitterness shows up just prior to the swallow. The finish is approaching astringency.

Strong aromas of oranges and earth/dirt. 

Taste follows but mellows on warming with a little less distinctness.

Soft, medium to full-bodied mouthfeel. Bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

JJJuliusss!,,Kentucky,4.52/5,"Its with a jaw tightening, lip smacking, mouth watering series of sensations that gives Tree House's power packed Julius a newer and juicier life that'll leave us stuttering for more.

The excellence in Jjjuliusss is felt starting with a similarly creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures as the original Julius. The beer's dense and foggy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. A slow separation of ale from froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to an even more creamy, tangy, sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and piney perfume than any before.

Less grassy and herbal in taste, the flavors that explode on the middle palate are dominant with all-things-orange. Tangerine, in all its tangy, fructose-sweet, branch-ripe and fresh squeezed vibrance springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting taste, a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus zest apply their final and lasting contributions to balance.

Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts fuller and plush, but trailing bitter, herbal and dry, the soft sappiness of freshly shaven spruce links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns itself with sorbet desserts- Its surprising that a single sixteen ounce can can hold so much flavor.","Oct 21, 2022"

JJJuliusss!,,Connecticut,4.16/5,"Canned on 7/29/22; consumed on 9/2/22

Pours a turbid, dark orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of rich cap, a massive, fluffy collar, and myriad spattering of chunky lacing tossed around the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end.

Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish.

A tropical hop smoothie, extensively creamy and leveled with weighty resins in-flux with the rampant saturation; a busy density attenuated to Tree House's usual high standard of NEIPA.","Sep 02, 2022"

16 fl. oz. can coded ""JJJUST GGGREAT 04/29/22 07:48:00"". Sampled on 05/15/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.

JJJuliusss!,,Pennsylvania,4.38/5,"Pours a murky dark orange with two fingers of dense yellowed foam head. Great retention and thick rings of lacing.

Big orange in the nose. Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears.

Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste. A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet.

Very soft, pillowy feel with restrained carbonation.

A top of class NEIPA. Tons of depth among the varied fruit flavors along with good light bitterness for balance.","Feb 21, 2022"
JJJuliusss!,,Germany,4.46/5,"One month old. Can to pint glass.

Look: Pours a full and hazy yellowish orange. Medium thick white head leaving a bit of lacing.

Smell: Orange. Grapefruit. Sweet and dank.

Taste: Ripe citrus fruits. Mostly orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium sweetness with a zesty, slightly bitter finish. 

Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Slightly sharp.

Overall: Typical Tree House IPA which could easily be mistaken for a higher ABV DIPA (which is great). Rather edgy than smooth, but still nicely balanced. Overall a very good brew and a prime example of the style.","Feb 05, 2022"
JJJuliusss!,,Pennsylvania,3.93/5,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Purchased directly from the brewery. Canned on 12/7/2021, so this is exactly 4 weeks old.

Look: Pours a very hazy deep, copper-colored orange color. There is a thick, frothy off-white head. Lots of chalky sediment / protein and hop deposits at the bottom of the can.

Smell: The aroma is tons of citrus, vitamins, and green notes. Notes of orange, peach, papaya, and mango. There is a chalkiness as well as a faint creaminess to the nose. Given all the hype about this beer, the nose is underimpressive.

Taste: I suppose that there is some redemption with the flavor on the palate compared to the nose, but I am still underwhelmed. There is definitely a ton of hop flavor here and there is an interesting play between juicy, aromatic, creamy, and bitter elements. Overall, it's much more bitter and chalky than I prefer

Feel: The moutfeel is above average. It looks kind of like orange soda, but feels more like an orange creamsicle. Still, nothing spectacular to me.

Overall: Could it be that I am just not a ""Tree House guy""? I do tend to like NEIPAs from other breweries. Is there just too much hype to live up to? I just don't get it; I have had a few Tree House beers, and by and large they have disappointed me.

This really is as good as it gets for NE-style IPA. It's so saturated with delicious hop character, with no burn, and a pleasant light bitterness on the back end. 

This is creamy, rich, and super drinkable. There's so much flavor, but it drinks light and breezy due to the lower ABV.

This is truly tremendous. With the glut of NE-style IPAs out there, it's easy to get burnt out and tired of this style. However, every so often, a truly phenomenal version comes along and reminds you of why so many people are obsessed with the style.","Jul 16, 2021"
JJJuliusss!,,Illinois,4.5/5,"This is a creamier and danker version of the original Julius. Outstanding Hazy hops, but I think I still prefer the original Julius a little bit more. It might be nostalgia because that was such a great beer the first time I tried it at the old brewery. Will have to arrange a side by side someday to find out which really is better.","Jul 06, 2021"
JJJuliusss!,,Connecticut,4.5/5,"Pours a hazy orange color with a thick white colored head with some lacing down the glass. Smells fruity, big melon, grapefruit, and orange aromas.

JJJuliusss!,,Pennsylvania,4.23/5,"There's some subtle differences between this and the base beer.

First, it's muddier in appearance. Second, the nose is more earthy and not as brightly citrusy. Finally, the body seems heartier and the malt has a stronger backbone.

The plusses and minuses equal a push in my book.","Jun 07, 2021"

High expectations here and luckily they’re met. It looks beautiful, smells amazing, feels amazing, and has a unique (for me) flavor profile with a perfect balance of bitterness and juiciness. Some 6.8% beers could leave me wanting more oomph, but they hit the nail here. This is why hazies rule now. I’m glad I have 3 more cans and will look for it again.","May 25, 2021"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Illinois,4.4/5,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2022 edition, had 1/26/23. 

Pours near black and opaque, with a half inch foamy head and some foamy lacing. Aromas of coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, some chocolate and oak, light char, bourbon as it warms. Flavors of coffee, dark roast malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla as it warms, light chocolate, a little malted milk balls. Has a decent amount of malt/hop bitterness. Smooth, a solid, full body, appropriately carbonated.

Lots of delicious coffee on top of the always solid base is a winning combination. The barrels are light, but effective. Hope this comes around again.","Jun 29, 2023"

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,North Carolina,4.54/5,"Look: It pours very dark brown with a brown head. It has low head retention. 

Smell: It has strong coffee aromas with chocolate. There are some vanilla elements with light wood. The alcohol is noticeable. 

Taste: It has strong coffee and chocolate flavors. There are some wood elements with vanilla. There is a very low brownie batter like flavor in the background. 

Feel: It has strong, but pleasant alcohol warming with a bitter finish. The bitterness is a little sharp, but certainly not overpowering.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,California,4.09/5,"A nice BA coffee stout. Very thin for today's market, which is an attribute in general to me but this one goes a little too far into the cold brew coffee territory.

Nose is excellent light roast coffee. Floral notes over dark chocolate, classic diner coffee, and some charred malt. Taste follows with the cold brew coffee note taking the lead. 

Great stuff. Not sure it's worth the premium over regular Speedway everyday. But now and again it definitely is.","Mar 30, 2023"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,California,4.44/5,"Great look, black with a good amount of tan head. Smell is amazing with coffee/vanilla/oak/bourbon.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,California,4.34/5,"2022. Bought for ~15$ at Alesmith's brewery in San Diego, CA for a beer tasting with my buddy Ron. Just a few quick notes because during these tastings I don't spend too much time writing.

A&S: Decent caramel-colored head, with some lacing. Black, but not jet-black colored beer. The aroma has chocolate and caramel components and is not ""in your face"".

T&M: The vanilla dominates. The beer is light but flavorful. Oaky is a major component as well. 14.2 is very deceptive especially before it warms. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. The carbonation is on the higher side of medium.

Overall: Very solid, would recommend.","Feb 20, 2023"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Idaho,4.49/5,"1847
Name: Speedway Stout, Vietnamese Coffee
Brewery: Alesmith
Location: San Diego, CA
Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout
ABV 14.2%
Date: 2022
This beer has been on my want list for years. I am finally able to review it. Using my Black Tuesday glass, I served it at 52 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy medium-dark tan head with average retention. The slow dissipation left no lacing on the glass. I am charting the color somewhere near SRM 32, dark brown, almost black. The overall appearance is above average for this style. 
Nosing the glass, I smell dark chocolate, coffee, earthiness, tobacco, bourbon, oak, molasses, bready, dark roasted malts, char, a touch of smokiness, a hint of soy sauce, vanilla, and caramel. 
The coffee in this beer is incredible; it is dark, roasty, and full-body. Other flavors in the beer are dark roasted malts, earthiness, a hint of floral, bourbon, oranges, cinnamon, chocolate, molasses, caramel, vanilla, oak, a touch of char, and slightly musty.
The mouthfeel is chewy and warm. The body is full, has low carbonation, and a lasting finish. 
This a great beer with lots of coffee flavors. I taste a slight off-flavor on the back end of the beer. Overall, glad I got to try this beer, a must for coffee lovers.","Feb 08, 2023"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Canada (ON),4.77/5,"Pours like motor oil and is pitch black in the glass. Leaves a brown head with some lacing.

Smells of coffee, huge roasted malt + caramel malt, some chocolate, a lot of vanilla, very mellow bourbon, maybe a hint of oak/barrel character.

Taste follows the nose with more sweet vanilla than I expected. The condensed milk flavour is incredible and makes this beer so identifiable. I tried this in a blind tasting of 20 comparable adjunct stouts a few days after my first bottle and there's nothing like it with the condensed milk character. The sweetness resembles burnt marshmallow. There is coffee but it's quite subtle and blends in nicely. Bourbon is noticeable but not centralising at all. Mellow barrel character. The vanilla from the oak is distinct from the sweetness from the Vietnamese coffee and it creates a very unique and complex milk chocolate vibe. I get very little ethanol in the flavour, but I've been drinking a lot of barrel aged stouts lately so it might be in the medium range. 

Full-bodied but not crazy syrup texture. Pretty great.

This is probably my new favourite adjunct stout. 2022 is my first year trying this release and it blew me away. It's so unique among its peers and really awesome. It's as sweet as it can be before my bias deters me from it. If you're not a huge fan of sweet stouts (I'm not), don't be afraid to try this. Totally worth the money, I'm glad I didn't only get one.","Feb 05, 2023"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Canada (AB),4.52/5,"Pours a rich very dark brown with finger of mocha to reddish tan head.
Aroma has a strong hit of coffee but with caramel malt, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, bourbon and a roasty, toasted marshmallow note.
Taste is coffee forward with sweet vanilla, brown sugar, a less pronounced caramel flavour, dark chocolate and a slightly bitter espresso hit. Certainly a bit of woody bourbon booziness.
Full though not thick mouthfeel with a bittersweet finish and the warmth 14.2% will give you.","Jan 30, 2023"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Pennsylvania,4.64/5,"Fresh off the Fed-Ex truck, here we go:

Pour into a sampler snifter emanates an expected opaque raven with quickly-receding milkshake-ish capper but with a slightly persistent gurgling ring of bubbles around the level line perimeter, some melting-show-on-the-window lacing as the glass is tipped; Up to the nose, it reveals scents of malts, strong coffee/espresso, dark chocolate and noticeable barrel presence; Taste accosts the senses with notions of said coffee & malts, chocolates both dark and milk, perhaps an illusion of cinnamon in there too; Body is rather thick & full but not stickily so; Finish is coffee-bitter yet with an undeniably lingering sweetness.

In sum i'd estimate it worthy of its world-class ranking. Of course will try to keep a few in storage for a future occasion.","Jan 27, 2023"

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Washington,4.45/5,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a half finger khaki head that dissipates to a thick cap with solid lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, coffee, bakers chocolate, vanilla and light bourbon and oak. Flavor is dark toasted malt with light char, dark chocolate, bourbon, oaky vanilla and hints of caramel. Long, lingering chocolate, bourbon and coffee finish. Medium bodied with moderate creaminess. A surprise find; Alesmith has always been a favorite of mine and a must buy when down in Southern California, but has had very spotty (or absent) distribution up in Seattle in recent years. A treat to actually get a version of the Vietnamese coffee Speedway, which has been on my try list for over a decade. And it was worth the wait. Beautiful deep flavor that stays balanced and flavorful throughout the taste, seemingly gaining greater depth into the finish. Bourbon is somewhat subdued for a barreled stout, but even that adds to the impression of balance. The coffee flavor is excellent and chocolate fine. Wisely offered in a 12 oz. Bottle appropriate for the big ABV, although I easily could have sipped on this all evening. Nicely done.","Dec 28, 2022"

Consumed 12/1/22

I'm excited to finally try this world class beer after hearing so many good things. I had a bit of 2022 Goose BCS coffee variant this year and thought it was a return to form for them, so barrel aged coffee stouts are a thing this year for sure. It's a nice looking stout, but all decent stouts looks the same, so who cares really. On the nose, it could us more barrel, but I like the coffee notes I'm getting. It's not a coffee bomb like Supermassive Cafe Deth from Rev, but you certainly know it's there. On the tongue I wish it were a bit thicker, but it's not thin. I just love a motor oil thick BA stout. It's better than the Rev coffee stouts in this regard for me. On the palate though this beer kills. It's smoother than other coffee stouts, but not bland or simple as that descriptive word can sometimes mean. I think this beer is sweeter than other coffee stouts, but not sweet like some regular BA stouts can be when not done well. I need to drink this next to the BCS and maybe the Rev and I'll update my review then. Don't miss this if you see it!","Dec 01, 2022"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Minnesota,4.07/5,"2022 edition. The Vietnamese Coffee sure does add chocolate notes in the aroma and flavor to such an extent that I think this was aged on cocoa nibs. Traditional coffee notes are not here.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Texas,4.41/5,"Picked up this beer recently at our local Total Wine, 2022 vintage. Enjoyed this beer while finishing decorating the Christmas tree!

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Maryland,4.58/5,"12oz bottle served @55 degrees in Avery snifter; aggressive pour with 2inch plumy tan head and full dark body ( walnut with burnt orange accents to light. Beautiful. Quickly dissolved to nice tan halo with a nice bit of broadcast lacing. These too disappeared within 10-15 minutes.
Nose was noticeable for vanilla, dark chocolate, some coffee and roasty malts.
Taste began with somewhat classic Alesmith barrel aged flavor. The bourbon, wood, vanilla somewhat overwhelmed the nuances of Vietnamese coffee. Kinda thought I better liked the non- BA version I had years ago. To be fair I’m now thinking I’m running out of any “wows” from Bourbon barreled/influenced stouts. They almost always seem to dominate the other flavors regardless of how good they are. Still enjoyable but getting rare to find a stand out bourbon barrel these days.
Ok, back to the beer. Coffee and dark chocolate becoming more dominant as beer further warmed. Noticeable astringency from booze but also a bit of dried dark fruit. Definitely more interesting. 
Then out of nowhere a sweeter Milk Chocolate just emerged and was a wonderfully delicious addition to the flavor. As beer further warmed the beer became much more gentle ( less in your face bourbon/ booze) and the flavors really merged nicely. Coffee started to be noticeably more complex. 
Body was smooth on initial pour but a bit bright with carbonation. Nothing wrong, just my tastes have changed to prefer a more dense velvety body. This was more like something I would have enjoyed 10-15 years ago. 
As beer warmed over time, and beer aired a bit the body took on a port like mouthfeel, which I really enjoyed.
Overall, I was initially disappointed that this heralded beer was not a real standout from other Alesmith barreled beers… let alone Speedways. Very good, but unsure why the hype.
But after sipping the last third of the glass I’m inclined to say this is more deserving of the praise, and I look fwd to enjoying more in the future now that beer is more available. 
Kudos!","Nov 22, 2022"
Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,,Ohio,4.19/5,"12 FL. OZ. bottle
Served in a snifter

This beer pours black and is topped with a scant mocha head that leaves little lacing.

Coffee and caramel are the first two things that I smell. I get a little chocolate and vanilla. I get some booze and oak, too.

Chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and booze flavors. 

Full bodied with a dry, yet smooth, mouthfeel

I have always heard what a great beer this was. BCBS lived up to the hype. This did not for me. I live in Ohio and Jackie O's makes several bourbon barrel aged beers that are significantly better than this beer. It's pretty good, but in the vast craft beer ocean, this beer isn't even a blip on my radar going forward. I am glad I tried it. I wouldn't buy it again, not because it is bad, it is just insignificant at this point.","Nov 19, 2022"

Dinner,,Maryland,4.51/5,"Poured on tap a snifter at Churchkey DC.

Beaming pale gold, with hints of orange color, and some fine carbonation. Soft creamy top of finger presented, with an off white appearance and bowled tilted lacing.

Aroma is a wonderful spiced orange. Juiced Christmas mandarin nose, with hints of spice and leafy green sensing hops. Soft bodied and creamy vanilla sensing malt to match make an impressive hop nose.

Palate is richly good, but no surprises. Creamy sensing body along with the flavors, if anything its mouthfeel is the most impressive. Mid palate rich in peeled and juiced orange tangerine notes. Finish accentuates soft green herbs, to an almost minty finish but a more pungent flavor, and sharper astringency like a soft pine. Still manages great balance keeping soft vanilla like flavored sweetness, and that classic Creamsicle orange like flavor.

It's not that exotic or dynamic, just a solid ipa done with exceptional base flavors. Very nice!","Jul 26, 2023"
Dinner,,Alabama,4.84/5,"So happy to finally try this historic IPA.

Mango, pineapple, and a slightly dank herbaceous quality on the nose. Palate is sharp and clean with pine, hints of green onion, and overripe oranges. Mildly sweet malt undertones balance the profile. Finishes clean and lightly bitter. Superb.","Apr 26, 2023"

S: Hoppy, floral and fruity with notes of pineapple, mango and sweet citrus fruits. Slightly piney and resinous.

T: First sweet and fruity, then bitter, grassy and piney. Sweet tropical fruits like pineapple and mango are paired with floral and herbal notes. Grapefruit peel is also there. Some earthy and woody undertones, too.

F: Full and a bit sticky on the one side, crisp and crushable on the other side. Medium carbonation. Minimal hop burn.

Dinner,,New Jersey,4.24/5,"(16.9 oz bottle, 64 18APR23; purchased cold from the brewery yesterday... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: pale, yellow-amber liquid, slight haze; beautifully rocky sponge of white foam... the head holds for a bit, but settles into a messy but steady cap though it doesn't lace much

S: pineapple, green onion, tropical taffy, undercurrent of orange peel, hint of pool liner vinyl(?!)... perhaps a subtle clean singe of ethanol... vibrant and eye-opening; sweaty later

T: triple sec zip up front, getting lost behind the peppery spice of booze and grapefruity hop, with an orangey-infused cereal malt drenching the palate floor, all followed by a subtle swell of floral-ity, that followed by more cereal grain, all while the pungent peppery electric hop swizzle stings the roof of my mouth... as it goes (and maybe the palate becomes too stunned?), the flavors relax into an obscured, obfuscated blend of pina colada and orange blossom water; moderate bitterness, most apparent way after the last sip, longest lingering flavor artefact

F: light-bodied, nearing thin (too attenuated, lacking supporting hop resins?), relatively pointed and punchy (booze)... the levity is excellent, but I'm craving more luscious, sticky leavings considering its exposed potency

O: visited Maine Beer for the first time yesterday and, wow!, are their beers far superior out of the bottle vs. draft... draft pours too cold, muting flavors, which were muddy anyway; the draft pour of this had little impact on my memory...

Dinner,,New Jersey,4.47/5,"Pours a dirty darker straw color; cloudy but see through; white head that laces quite beautifully, a dense film lingers and lingers.

The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me.

Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes.

This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present.

Well it is easy to see why this beer has the reputation it does. The aroma alone is intoxicating but the flavors and feel combine to make this a very good beer; I love the bite and big hop presence on such an aromatic beer. Lovely beer.","Sep 04, 2022"
Dinner,,Connecticut,4.14/5,"I've never come across this highly regarded beer, so was pleasantly surprised to see it on tap when I was out to dinner last night. The appearance was that of.....beer. Cloudy and medium yellow, with almost no head. The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table. Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either. 

The nose was a different story. I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer. 

The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose. Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs). The feel, however was amazing. Very full, creamy and pillowy. Absolutely excellent.

Dinner,,New Hampshire,4.36/5,"From a 16.9oz bottle, dated 07/29/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing.

Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles.

Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon.

Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet.

As always when rating MBC bottles, overall score is marked down 0.25 in recognition of the stupid, overpriced pint-plus bottles. Because principles, right? (Replaces a 4.46 rating without a review from 11/05/15… thank you, Dr. J. for the rare opportunity to have this one again).","Aug 15, 2022"

Dinner,,New York,5/5,"Beer rating is very subjective. 

I own a NYC sandwich shop in SoHo and FiDi for 30 years. We carry a small curated can list of 18-24 rotating cans and bottles and one line for draft. I carry beer at the newer location in FiDi because I’m a craft beer/beer enthusiast and I love people that believe in their work. I won’t review beers that I don’t love because whether or not I like a beer, it’s someone’s life work. I refuse to to give a review that may not take into account of the struggles to survive every owner has. To be sensitive and kind is more important than my hurtful review, so I just don’t give it. 

I also don’t review one category next to another. If I’m loving pilsners at the moment, I don’t review it against a stout for example. I take in consideration rating IPAs against IPAs, IIPA, imperials, lagers, porters, etc. I may review a Pilsner that’s not better than some of the other categories, but i give a high score because it’s the best of that category. I don’t believe that my opinion is the best one, but it takes into consideration the hard life’s work that goes into living your career and wanting to make a difference. 

I am writing this because I visited Maine Beer Company over the weekend and made sure to bring some beer home. 

Dinner. 

I’ve never had this from a bottle and was super excited to pour one. 

I’m am giving this beer a 5. And thank you MBC for being you and being amazing. 

This is not like other brewers, this is unique to them. 

So true to character and so pleasant to drink.

Few beers get my highest rating, but this is well deserved. Bless you and thank you Maine Beer Company.

Dinner,,Connecticut,4.49/5,"Pours a clean but hazy orange color with a short and medium bodied white colored head that laces the glass a bit on the way down. Smells of sweet toasted malt and then a floral/piney/citrusy hop aroma. The taste is of sweet toasted malt and tart grapefruit followed by floral/piney hop finish. It's crisp, lighter bodied than expected, warming, and a bit dry at the end. Overall, excellent!","Sep 17, 2021"

Appearance: Pours a cloudy apricot with a one finger head that leaves some streaky lacing as it reduces to a film

Smell: Tart lemon, green apple, white wine grape and oak, layered with some barnyard funk

Taste: Tart lemon forward with white wine grape and green apple rounding out the lactic parade; oak and barnyard funk, through the middle, with a sour yogurt finish

Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with moderate carbonation; puckery

Overall: Long time want and glad to finally get a chance to taste this; lives up to its billing","Nov 26, 2022"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Illinois,4.55/5,"At long last! It was always scandalous to me that the top rated gueuze on this site was from outside belgium, and while I still feel this is not the best gueuze I have ever had, I can now see why it is in that echelon of the style. Cloudy yellow pour, finger of sudsy white foam, good mix of spotted and splotchy lacing. Lemon, sliced tart apple, lacto, barnyard funk, white grape, flowers, hay and earthy oak in the potent nose. Taste is just as potent, but not as complex as the sour notes lead more than the barnyard funk, oak backs the sour fruits well, slight earth, yogurt funk, and decent hay round out. A more sunny disposition for the style, leans sour more than funky but both present in spades, but the body is light and nuanced despite the potency. I would love to age a bottle of this as I think it would age really nicely!","Nov 10, 2022"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Alabama,4.65/5,"2022 Vintage. Side-by-side with Mother of All Gooze Anniversary Blend.

Nose is sweet, tart, funky. Notes of underripe peach, lemon zest, and bright, musty funk. 

Palate tart and full of stone fruit flavors. Medium acid and a touch of minerality. You can tell the youth on this, whereas on MOAG you really can tell the age on the blend.","Oct 10, 2022"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Connecticut,4.47/5,"Received from @dimidiata. Pours a bright golden color with a small amount of short-lived white head that receded to a thin ring. Fully translucent, almost clear. Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer. 

Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean. 

Overall, an absolutely wonderful beer.","Jul 23, 2022"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Massachusetts,4.57/5,"2022 vintage

Review 1100!! I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion, and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA? Well, Gueuze-inspired I should say, based on recent thread. Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it

After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic

While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of bright white wine, stone, lemon yogurt, orange juice, apple skin, straw, and light honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness

Super annoying cork aside, this is a fantastic treat of a beer! There's something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation, in the most flattering way. I need to get more to cellar, cheers BA!","May 08, 2022"
Duck Duck Gooze,,California,4.54/5,"the 2016 is on point right now. Very complex, sharp and interesting wine barrel aged sour. if you haven't had a chance it's very much worth seeking this beer out!","Jan 04, 2021"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Hawaii,4.5/5,"Was so hyped for this beer, and it is good...but left feeling disappointed overall","Jan 02, 2021"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Maine,4.6/5,"2016 Vintage

750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer.

Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here.

Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate.

Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers.

Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning.","Dec 31, 2020"

Duck Duck Gooze,,New Hampshire,4.05/5,"Poured from a tap at the initial release of Duck Duck Gooze in 2009, lovingly collected in a 16oz clear Solo cup.

So I was doing consulting work in SoCal in 2009. Gueuze wasn't my thing; I'd never had a sip in 40 years of fine beer drinking. My son informed me that the Lost Abbey was putting out this Duck Duck Goose beer that Saturday, that his friend would have donated his right arm to be there, and could I pick up a bottle for his friend. It was a bit of a hike from where I was to where the beer was, and I'd have to stay the weekend to boot. His friend is a good guy, so sure, I'll stay.

I arrived early for the opening, or so I thought. A very long line snaked through the parking lot 90 minutes before release time, and I took my place. I remember the sun was beating down from a cloudless sky, and I was getting an unanticipated sunburn atop my head.

Finally I heard a cheer from the front of the line that quickly snaked by me to the end of the line (I couldn't see it.) There was a 2 bottle limit on purchases, which initially bummed me out (this was the first time I waited in a beer line in 30+ years.) However, inside the warehouse a bar was set up and they were serving healthy pours of DDG.

My initial impressions were negative, as in ""what is this?"" But as I made my way to the bottom of my Solo cup, it started to grow on me. I was able to get a second pour - same cup - and this one I took my time to savor. I've been drinking gueuze til today. 

And the friend: he ended up getting both bottles with my compliments. He repaid me years later with a bottle of Kate the Great. Both of us are older, life's gotten in the way so neither of us follow beer as we used to, until for me anyway COVID has reintroduced me to BA. Hopefully beer follies will begin anew, and I'll be standing in a few more beer lines.","May 17, 2020"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Florida,5/5,"2019 vintage poured into a teku-style glass. Looks like fresh squeezed peach juice with a thin white ring of head and small islands on the surface. Aroma is sweet stone fruit jam, vinegar, and wild yeast funk. Flavors are peaches, apricots, nectarines, and acidic vinegar. It has a very full mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation and puckering tartness. The finish is mouth-coating, and the flavors linger in a good way. This beer definitely lives up to its hype.","May 08, 2020"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Colorado,4.16/5,"January 1st, 2016 - Ringing in the new year with a resoundingly good (and increasingly rare) sour from Lost Abbey. This treat is a lovely scent with a well toned sourness, and a touch of banana esters that play second fiddle. The central sourness on the tongue is also tuned to perfection, with just a slight edge twisting the salivary glands and a lovely carbonation. Each sip is its own little rollercoaster of dramatic joy followed by the post-dopamine relief in the aftertaste, cycled again with a new and fresh flavor.","Mar 14, 2020"
Duck Duck Gooze,,New York,4.65/5,"2016 Bottle poured into teku.

Orange, clear, crisp, active carbonation, frothy off white head.

Citrus zest, grapefruit rind aroma. Slightest hint of funk, some tart apple.

Flavor combines light zesty citrus (lemon) with earthy grass/hay. Some oak balances the tartness and melds with wine grape. A bit of sweetness smooths out a light layer of funk.

Moderate carbonation, soft, tart, medium body.

Overall an excellent brew, excited to try the next vintage that I have in my cellar.","Feb 26, 2020"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Ohio,4.23/5,"Foggy amber-orange with a fuzzy off-white head settling to a thin white film and bubbling surface with a fuzzy bumpy ring.

Smoothly tart green apple, lemon and grapefruit pair with a light sweetness from the red wine barrel, which also contributes a distinct red grape flavor.

The medium body is a little silky and lightly crisp, easily continuing to develop a mild but splintery neutral oak that brings out accents of apricot and toasted sesame before a lightly stinging semi-dry finish.

This would be killer with a ton of apricot in it, as DDG really reminds me of Fou, or at least what its base might be.

---

We enjoyed a 2016 vintage in the fall of 2021, and appearance was clearer, while the taste was woodier with a superbly nutty funk. However, taste also had a touch of butter, while also being more acidic, with a touch of white wine vinegar. I'm not going to change my score, but am a little conflicted on whether I liked it overall or not.","Sep 03, 2019"

Duck Duck Gooze,,Minnesota,4.71/5,"When I took my first and only trip to Great American Beer Fest in 2017, I didn't know a lot about The Lost Abbey - I'd heard a few things about Veritas, and I'd tried a select few of their beers. I was a fan, but I didn't pursue their beer to the degree that I do now. I knew that Duck Duck Gooze was on the top 250 on Beer Advocate - but I never expected that I'd be able to try it.

Well now. I recently made a Facebook friend who used to live in San Diego but now lives and brews in northern Minnesota. Happy coincidence! He happens to love sours, just like I do... he helped me out with a bottle of Duck Duck Gooze (among other things) in our very first trade. I was thrilled, and still am - the beer is fantastic!

It's interesting to me how DDG differs from Belgian gueuze though - the characteristic funk seems to be entirely absent, and the nose doesn't pop to quite the same degree. It smells very nice, but it's a different sort of aroma - and taste. There's a bit of cheese to the taste, and a very light, clean, crisp sort of sour and tart character. Again, the Belgian funk is missing. Perhaps this has been lost with time, but it surprises me as older Belgian lambic still seems to retain that funk. There's also a marked lack of suspension - there's no noteworthy presence of fruit, yeast, or foreign matter of any kind. I don't mind that! I know some really enjoy that in Belgian lambic, but it's a happy absence as far as I'm concerned.

I'd have to say that DDG characterizes all of the things that I love about gueuze, while it also happens to have bypassed the aspects that I am not such a big fan of. It's a terrific beer, and really demonstrates why Lost Abbey is such a hyped and touted brewery. I think that I will always try far harder to pick up bottles of Russian River sours, because they're just a lot more accesible - but I will never pass on the chance to try another bottle of Lost Abbey. Their sours, wilds, and lambics are tremendous, and DDG is one of their best.","Aug 19, 2018"
Duck Duck Gooze,,Wyoming,4.65/5,"Wow, this was an amazing surprise to have tried this. By far one of the better Gueuzes I've ever had","Jun 25, 2018"
Lou Pepe - Kriek,,Ohio,4.94/5,"Seeing the tape get pulled off the menu listing for the 2020 bottle at the Cantillon bar definitely got the old heart pumping. As the freshly, horizontally uncorked bottle rested in its lambic basket, it began to slowly push a soft mauve foam out of the spout before I gave it a tilt to pour a damn near smoothie-like stream into the glass. There it displays fully opaque garnet with a dense cotton candy head.

I said St. Lam was the juiciest Loon? Scratch that, this is like Schaerbeek puree with mild hints of cinnamon marzipan delivered on a pillowy body with a surprisingly balanced acidity. Even still, a complex oak tannin brings us to a bone dry finish before exhaling a touch of black pepper and perhaps chevre. A delicious candied quality further emerges as it warms.

I'm not sure I ever imagined just what made LPK the highly coveted fruited lambic that it is, but clearly, that distinguisher is decadence. This is undoubtedly the thickest lambic I've ever had, and in all the most delicious ways.","Jul 05, 2023"
Lou Pepe - Kriek,,Missouri,4.64/5,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

Taste is cherry and tartness -- interesting that the aroma seemed fairly sweet, but the taste is not. There's a slight bitterness to it that complements surprisingly nicely.

Lou Pepe - Kriek,,Thailand,4.59/5,"Cherry red with a touch of amber, lots of carbonation, a hint of haze, and a finger of Pepto Bismol pink head.

Smells acidic and fruity, of vinegar, cherries, spices . Notes of cloves and nutmeg, deep, cellar like funk, and dusty attic, just like the Cantillon Brewery where I purchased this masterpiece at the end of 2013. 

Sour, dry and fruity. Very acidic but with a softness that makes it non abrasive. The essence of cherries and red fruits are in there, along with the breweries classic funk and cellar and dust. Cobwebs come to mind, and macaroni. Floral notes are also present.

Medium body, moderate, foamy carbonation, and a very dry but smooth finish.

The label says 2011, so when I purchased this in Brussels at the brewery in 2013, it was already 2 years old. Today its been in the bottle for 5 years.

Beer 1400!!! I purposely saved this one for this landmark review since I reviewed the base version and the imperial version a few weeks back. This has been a long time want of mine, and luckily I was able to get the whole series at once. This bourbon barrel-aged variant has been sitting at the highest rated Imperial Porter for a long time on BA, and #38 overall. Let’s see if it lives up to the hype

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy dark tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

The bourbon is definitely present in the nose, making the whole thing quite a bit sweeter but still really good. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, charred oak, salty bacon, medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and light brown sugar

It’s an absolute smack in the face of every single element in taste, wow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting smoky bacon, milk chocolate, maple candy, sweetened coffee, sweet bourbon, raisin, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of salty bacon, charred oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, burnt caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, smoked malt, and vanilla

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a warming alcohol presence

Man, it’s been so much fun trying my way through this series. This one is the clear winner. I hope I get a chance to try them all fresh one day","Nov 26, 2022"
Morning Wood,,Illinois,4.59/5,"22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.

Poured into Durobar Charente glass.

Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down. 

Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.

Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all. 

Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure.","Feb 03, 2022"
Morning Wood,,Illinois,4.53/5,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.

Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish.","Feb 02, 2022"
Morning Wood,,Florida,4.5/5,On tap at Castaways for the tap takeover. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Loads of maple and bourbon aromas. The taste follows suit with pronounced black coffee and dark roasted malts. Hints of oak. Good body and mouthfeel.,"Apr 30, 2021"

T: roasty coffee, chocolate malt, maple/brown sugar, Slight smoke and/or bitterness. No bacon specifically. 
F: medium. 
Overall: Very good porter. Hard to distinguish between this and a stout. Maple sweetness and coffee dominate. Reminds me of beers I recently had... mornin’ delight, kbbs, cbs, and that’s a pretty high compliment considering their ratings. Clearly world-class barrel aging going on.","Dec 28, 2020"
Morning Wood,,Tennessee,4.44/5,"I got this in a trade, and the date is smudged off :-( 

Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing. 

Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through. 

Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more. 

Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple. 

Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+.","Oct 03, 2020"
Morning Wood,,Colorado,4.74/5,"Jet black body topped with a thick and creamy, tan colored head. Alluring aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa and vanilla; faint, boozy scent. Decadently rich, sweet flavors; milk chocolate and maple syrup; vanilla; whiskey. Heavy, silky smooth body; velvety and chewy; dull, prominent sweetness to the mouthfeel; twinge of alcohol warmth.

A heady, extremely tasteful and lip smacking bit of rich porter flavor. World class all the way...","Aug 16, 2020"
Morning Wood,,Florida,5/5,"2019 Bottle poured into Brandy Snifter

L: Dark and beautiful as a porter should be. Great tan head with good lacing throughout the entire (short) life of the beer.
S: Slightly sweet and inviting. Maybe a hint of bourbon on the nose (but my nose is pretty weak in this area.)
T: This is my #1 beer so I personally feel that is is the best porter I've ever tried. I routinely buy every bottle I can find. Great taste that's slightly sweet without any alcohol burn/aftertaste. Smooth tasting with a hint of maple and bourbon. Best porter or stout I've had.
F: Everything a porter should be, smooth and silky with a clean and hearty feel in the mouth.

My #1 beer!!!! Closely followed by Untitled Art White Chocolate Macadamia, Untitled Art Hazelnut, CBS, and a little further down the list, Wicked Weed German Chocolate Cake just to give you some reference.","Jun 27, 2020"

22oz Bottle purchased in Nov 2019. bottled Oct 2017. Poured into a tulip glass. 

Pour: deep black with a 1/2 finger tan head that dissipates pretty quickly leaving a thick ring. Some bubble lacing. 4.0

Nose: Maple, coffee, some booze. 4.25

Taste: follows the nose with some extra bitterness on the coffee, a hint of cinnamon, some vanilla/marshmallow, chocolate. Probably some salt/bacon but could be the power of suggestion. 4.25

Feel: super smooth. Low carbonation. Slightly viscous. 4.5

Overall: really good, very similar to CBS with maybe more bitter coffee, slightly less maple. Worth trying and will seek out again. 4.25


Thanksgiving 2018

Morning Wood,,Pennsylvania,4.75/5,"Pours a jet black. Aroma is wonderful mix of bourbon, maple, coffee & caramel. Very pleasant. I lingered over the smell much more than usual. The taste was equally pleasing and quite complex. It comes at you in waves. Starting with the sweet maple with brown sugar, caramel & chocolate, and then shifting to a more roasted flavor to go with the coffee. All the while a constant bourbon flavor. Simply awesome.

Morning Wood,,Indiana,4.59/5,"Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out as black as night and forms a pinky worth of tightly packed, peanut butter fudge colored bubbles to rest on top as a crown. 4.25

The nose brings a plethora of different layers; creamy coffee, semi sweet chocolate, maple sweetness, burnt brown sugar and slightly toasted coconut on the backend, all resting on top of a smokey/salty base. The barrel is detectable through some very slight dry oak notes. 4.5

The taste comes in with sweet maple before melding into slightly roasty, creamy coffee notes. The smokey/salty layers are still present, tangling with brown sugar and semisweet chocolate. It makes me think of coating maple bacon strips with brown sugar, putting them in the oven, and then pulling them out and drizzling them with chocolate, all while you are enjoying your morning coffee. The barrel is very slightly present, offering just a touch of dry oak and a kiss of dark fruit at the very end. If you weren’t searching for it, you might not even guess it was there. 4.75

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. The carbonation is low-low medium, allowing the drink to shine. It’s very smooth and drinkable, hardly any warmth from the bourbon barrels. It does offer a touch of dry oak, but almost none of the 13% ABV is showing through. It’s dangerous. 4.5

Overall, I’d say the balance and plethora of layers and the way they mix are the winners here. Nothing is trying to take away from the other, just all tangling perfectly to create an amazing drinking experience. 4.5","May 05, 2019"

Morning Wood,,Missouri,4.4/5,"Pours black with a finger of caramel-colored foam. Head retention is poor. Aroma is maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, oak, and roasty and toasty malts. Very deep aroma with a springy sweetness. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty and caramely malts and medium-roast coffee, chocolate, cocoa, maple syrup, toffee and caramel. A touch of bourbon and its heat and woody oak balances out the sweetness a little. It's sweet, but not overly sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a very smooth and lightly creamy texture. It's thickness and consistency is medium-thick. Overall, maple syrup and coffee is huge and pairs well with bourbon. Heat is minimal, especially when considering the 11% ABV.

Appearance - Body is black as the night with a dark brown short head that disappears into some wispy bubbles. The dark brown head was expected and didn’t disappoint.

Smell - Malty and molasses, chocolatey and some boozy bourbon hints. Not overpowering but pleasant.

Taste -Malty right away. Some coffee tones and darker fruits. Smooth chocolate finish with some mild hints of booze. Great taste and pleasantly surprised by the subdued alcohol boozy presence throughout the sampling. Very rich beer.

Feel -Lower carbonation, minimal boozy sting and a lighter body than expected. 

Overall - Great beer that I feel privileged to try. I couldn’t drink many of these in one sitting as they are pretty rich but a very enjoyable beer everyone should sample.",Monday at 03:13 AM

Notes: Labeled at 14% ABV. Very dark brown-black body beneath a short head of tan. Malty in the nose with notes of dark malt, Bourbon, roastiness, charred oak, vanilla, and coconut. The flavor is intense. It's malty, sweet, and a touch ""hot"" from the alcohol with notes of coffee-like roastiness, Bourbon, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, plum, molasses, charred oak, caramel, vanilla, and coconut.

L: Solid, jet black. Very slight desaturated brown head.
S: Strong sweet chocolate nose, a bit of something like caramel and even some coconut. A bit of booze.
T: Dark coffee and chocolate brownie, not terribly sweet. Again, something akin to lightly toasted coconut flakes. Surprisingly there seems to be some more acidity than I was expecting. Big boozy finish.
F: A bit lighter than expected, but still fairly heavy. Slight carbonation. Moderately warming.
O: A brighter stout than I was expecting, but still fantastic. Just the right amount of warmth, and plenty of rich, dark and sweet flavors to play with. One of the best stouts I've had.","May 31, 2023"
Parabola,,New York,4.55/5,"2021 Vintage. Pours a very dark cola brown, half-inch tan collar of head that leaves wisps of lacing. Nose is big on whiskey and rye, along with wood, vanilla, char, licorice, molasses, brown sugar; aromas really gel and round at as it warms. Flavor is equally complex - lots of spice from the rye, sweet molasses, wood, Canadian whiskey, light vanilla, sugar in the raw. It manages to avoid becoming an overly boozy nightmare while still highlighting the spirit barrels, all without loading up on sugars and adjuncts. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, though not so much as BCBS; there's also some light carb as well. Pretty exceptional.","Mar 25, 2023"

Parabola,,,4.83/5,"L: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - Jet black pour with a decent head appearing. About 3 fingers length to be exact. No lacing left behind as the foam dissolves back into liquid form.
S: Getting a sweet bourbon cherry aroma from the first sniff, can definitely smell some coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and oak in there. Very well done on the nose! It hit all the marks that they advertised and it was very noticeable/ well balanced. This deserves a 5/5 for me.
T: Tasting bourbon, cherry up front as the nose indicates. Getting some big coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak as the nose followed. It's rare the nose is tasting the exact same in a similar order to the nose.
F: A good sipper - easy to sip in my opinion, full bodied, medium acidity. 
O: I can see why this is a world class beer. this big 13.5% beer showed us what we can expect on the firestone walker website and this is exactly what we got. I tried to look for more flavors and one can argue it can have some dark fruits but I would say it's pretty rare a beer company hits it spot on and actually tastes good. Good job firestone, I applaud you for this one.","Mar 04, 2023"
Parabola,,New Jersey,2.9/5,"2022. It didn't taste like a Russian Imperial Stout to me, too sweet, in fact I think Rasputin is a better representative. And forget about comparing it to Sam Smith's RIS. I was thankful the bourbon still came through strong which did a lot for the taste. I think the most noticeable things about this beer are its ABV of 14.1% and it's ""weight"", both of which put it in the one-and-done category...and that's if you can finish the 12 oz bottle, which I was barely able to do after about 2 hours from the time I poured it. The ABV and the weight really work against the enjoyability of this beer.","Feb 24, 2023"
Parabola,,,4.63/5,"Drinking a 2017, which I've had in the cellar. I am not an expert on the true evaluation of the RIS but I fell in love with this one after my first trip to Firestone/Walker in El Paso de Robles about 12 or 13 years ago. This started me on RIS style. F/W have a cellar room where you can buy the good stuff. I recommend a visit, as the wine country out there is fabulous and F/W is affiliated with many of the wineries (sourcing casks, mixers, etc). The beer is complex and has so many taste notes to it that I won't try to guess them all. It should satisfy almost anyone. I highly recommend putting one away for a few years. I have a few more. Tonight my wife is celebrating her 60th, and I will be having a 5 year old Deschutes Abyss or two after the Tomahawk Ribeye BBQ tonight.

Parabola,,Florida,4.65/5,"2021 vintage 12 ounce bottle, poured at 53° into a Firestone Walker snifter.
Perfect brown head rises above a deep black sea and leaves a nice ring inside the glass. Drizzly lacing.
Smells wonderful - dark malt, chocolate, coffee, prune, licorice, barrel char.
Drinking like a millionaire. All of the aromas spill forth into the mouth and everybody takes a bow. Multiple barrels makes for a taster’s experience. The peppery spice of the rye barrel carries long, which helps cut into the sweet elements of this Russian Imperial Stout. Vanilla. Fudge. Barrel.,. on and on.
Feel is not overly dense, which I appreciate. Medium carbonation.
Overall - World Class Stout and totally worthy. The art of the craft!","Jan 09, 2023"
Parabola,,Canada (ON),4.98/5,"I'm reviewing the 2021 3 barrel aged release because it's my new favourite parabola release ever.

Pours how you would expect for a big stout. Motor oil on the pour itself then dark black in the glass.

Smells amazing. Tons of roasted malt coffee notes, subtle chocolate, big whisky barrels on the nose, the rye barrel gives a distinct note which is sort of like burnt rye bread (big surprise). I'm not getting any cherry but maybe some faint hint of fig. Zero ethanol on the nose.

The taste is really good. The rye barrel shines here as it balances the bourbon sweetness. Lots of roasted malt, some coffee notes, some sweet bourbon mixed with subtle rye spice, good oak that gives a touch of vanilla character. The finish is long and is very barrel heavy, which I like.

Mouthfeel is like 2% thinner than I'd like but I think that might be a carbonation thing rather than the actual gravity. It's still nice and full bodied for me.

This is actually my favourite beer right now. I love what the rye and wheated whisky barrels did for the balance of the flavour profile. This is probably the most balanced big stout I've ever had, especially among barrel aged stouts. I think this is well worth the price. 2021 was a great year for parabola.","Dec 16, 2022"
Parabola,,Texas,4.69/5,"Parabola is dark as night like melted chocolate with a nice mocha colored head. I smell molasses. I taste molasses, strong and semi sweet. I get some woody alcohol in the mix. What a blend. The different whiskey barrels are very amazing. The alcohol is well hidden and you can take big bites and chew on this beer. The alcohol settles to the bottom and although that's science, the flavors also sink there and are more pronounced in strength too, gives a different aspect of the beer. Including the smell.

Overall: Sort of a whale for me, I've been wanting to try for years and finally FW sent some to MN. Very thick stuff, tasted great then kind of had an awkward phase of “here's beer” and “here's barrel” before coming back together as a unit. Tasty stuff!","May 28, 2022"

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut

It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat

F: Smooth and thick like I like my women.

S: Raisins, roasty, some barrel.
T: All sorts of things happening. When colder it matches the nose; as it warms you get rich dark chocolate, a little vanilla, and some booziness as well.

O: This is damn tasty and it certainly takes the chill oughta' these old bones.","Feb 10, 2022"
Parabola,,Illinois,4.37/5,"It is difficult for me to get as hyperbolic as the average ratings for Parabola. But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.

I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees.","Jan 15, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Virginia,4.41/5,"Purchased a 2023 bottling in 2023. Poured at cellar temperature into a wine glass as my goblet did not survive a move.

Vigorous head on pour half filled my glass with fluffy, off-white foam like a well-made cappuccino. Excellent retention and it took a long time to settle enough to pour a proper glass. Beer is a ruddy brown with tawny highlights. Some haze and fine carbonation.

Immediate malt on opening, like walking into a bakery. Warm, whole grain type bread. Putting my nose into the glass, my impression is of balance. It's subtle and difficult to pull out specific notes, but I get cherry, a bit of almond, orange peel, and a light mineral aspect. The expected regional notes of banana and clove are present but subdued

Taste is the expected clove and banana, plus brown sugar, cardamom, cream. Back notes of coffee beans and mineral water.

Mouthfeel starts out with a Sprite-like effervescence calming to a velvety, creamy texture from the head.

Drinkability? Yeah, it's drinkable. If you can get ahold of enough of it to have a session, sure, you could do it. But after only one bottle I can already tell I'm starting to miss subtleties that I picked up at the beginning. Much more affordable beers to tie one off with. But for any Beer Advocate, this is a bucket list item worth checking off the list.","Aug 25, 2023"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Vermont,4.88/5,"Pours dark amber into a snifter. Very thin and white head which mostly disappears with a slight film left throughout the consumption.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,England,4.17/5,"Drank this is a Belgian beer cafe in Warsaw Old Town a few years ago, so reviewing from memory. It was definitely kind of expensive, but not as expensive as I was expecting. On a cold, snowy, lonely night...it seemed the perfect idea.

It definitely looks as beautiful as any beer I have seen. Deep, dark and mystical. And I remember the aromas being similar...deep and mystical...and complex.

I remember it being mega smooth. My initial impression was that this is much better than Rochefort 8 and 10. Much much better. As I have never been a fan of either. This has much more complexity, and is less creamy...and kind of dark and full of different flavour sensations that are difficult to put into words. However as I am reviewing from memory, I will need to review again when I actually have one with me when I am writing. 

So yes, this is kind of a vague review, but I don't remember liking it more than a mega amazing West Coast IPA, or even a Chouffe IPA. It was kind of like a Chimay Bleu but wth much more complexity. So these ratings are my approximated memories. Ciao","Jun 10, 2023"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Washington,4.61/5,"Bottle courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ.
Actually drank this about a year ago with two friends I was sharing bottles with. We did a side-by-side with St Bernardus Abt 12, long my favorite Quad. Although I've left alone my ridiculous scoring of that one (from around 20yrs ago) as it was an amazing experience for me at the time, this actually was the superior beer. I just score a lot more realistically these days, compared to when I was a NOOB and whose mind had just been blown by my first Quadrupel Ale.","Jun 03, 2023"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Texas,4.75/5,"Got a chance to try this in Amsterdam from a bar that has a guy drive into Belgium every three weeks to pick up a case from various Trappist breweries. The praise for this beer is well-earned. Probably the finest beer I have ever had, and certainly the best quad, even better than my beloved Abt 12. There is nothing at fault with it. It is a lovely experience. I hope I have a chance to try it again one day.","Jun 03, 2023"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,England,4.94/5,"Such an amazing beer! The ""Westy"" is the Unicorn of Beers. I bought 48 Bottles (2 crates) at the Abbey in Dec 2017. Still have about 15 bottles left. Its been interesting experiencing them age over time. They are still drinking well, but IMHO I think they peaked after about 3 years.
I did a side by side tasting party in 2019 including beers from all 6 Belgian Trappist Ales (Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Bleue, Rochefort 10, Orval, Achel Brune, Westvleteren 12(St Sixtus Abbey), and others (St Bernardus 12, Leffe Brune, La Trappe Quad). Many of these are excellent, but the Westy 12 was head and shoulders above the rest in terms of overall complexity and quality. I agree with many of the tasting notes posted before and I wouldn't do it justice to try, but I will say if you enjoy the strong quad style do yourself a favor and try one. 

OBTW I had to call and hit about 500 busy tones before finally getting through to a Monk and placing my order in 2017; and I had to go in person to the Abbey to pick them up. I believe they now have a website that you can order for delivery. Check their calendar for times and details.","Apr 27, 2023"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Pennsylvania,4.24/5,"Trappist Westvleteren 12 from Brouwerij Westvleteren, 10.5 oz bottle. Received from @Superspak about a million NBS BIFs ago – thanks Ian! Reviewed 05/03/23 (Review 3058). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.

Appearance – 3.5.
First pour –Deep Amber (SRM 15), clear.
Body – Amber Brown (SRM 18), opaque. Under direct light, same coloration but loaded with precipitate and suspended particles. When rear lite, opaque except amber at the edges.
Head – Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), almond, high density and fizzy, receding to neither crown nor cap, just an intermittent bubble ring.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Roasted malt, dates, and figs, sweet candi sugar, no yeast, no hops. No ethanol (10.2 % ABV as marked on cap) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Roasted malt, dark fruity, slightly sweet. No hops, no yeast. Weak gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 3.5 – Medium; lightly creamy initially, thins as it warms; lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 Not bad but maybe cellared a bit too long. The aroma and flavor are fine, but the appearance and body have suffered.","Mar 05, 2023"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,California,4.41/5,"Best by 2014 (month has worn away), so, bottled in 2011. A kind gift from my sister-in-law. Poured from a 330mL bottle into my Westvleteren chalice. 10.2% ABV. Served at 55F.

Chestnut/burnt umber liquid with copper/caramel highlights and a small beige cap receding quickly to a lasting collar. Adequate retention; fine lacing; delicate yet viscous legs.

Lovely rich malty/estery aromatics suggest plum, fig, date, toffee, and an old European cobbler's shop. Weighty yet perfectly integrated and inviting. No perceptible oxidation.

Flavor follows the nose but is joined by a low earthy bitterness and some suggestions of brandy and eucalyptus. Long, linear, medium-dry finish. Rounded and rich with some complex stewed fruit elements. 

Modest carbonation, but holding up well given the age. Slightly thin and quite warming. 

More than the sum of its parts, and still a top tier example of the style, though I look forward to updating this review one day with a fresh bottle.","Feb 27, 2023"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Canada (ON),4.75/5,"Found this at a local Austrian restaurant. Bottle was 3 years old when I opened it.

Pours quad colour. Brown with some red tint and a ton of big particulates clearly visible. 

Smells like biscuit, sweet bready yeast, apricot, a little caramel but not the oxidised kind, some herbal notes but no spice.

Tastes amazing, Tons of that bready Belgian yeast at the start and lots of nice roasted biscuit from the malt. More fruit comes through on the palate than the nose and its integrated very well. Just sweet enough. The finish is bittersweet and dry. There's maybe the faintest hint of alcohol but it's hard to tell for me.

Mouthfeel is good. The gravity works here.

I can definitely see why people say Rochefort 10 is more complex, but I think my personal taste aligns with this quad more. The bottle I had lacked that ""spice"" character you get from a lot of abbey quads and I'm not sure if that's due to age or just the recipe itself. In any case, I personally enjoyed this beer more than R10 and Abt 12. Definitely stop by the monastery if you happen to be near Belgium.","Dec 16, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Pennsylvania,4.99/5,"I drank this on a Belgian beer tour in the visitors center across from the St. Sixtus monastery. Having heard about this beer for years, I was apprehensive that it might not stand up to its reputation. No fear...as good if not better than expected. Many of the beers we drank that week were ""Beers of the Gods"" and the Westvleteren is the beer the Gods drink on special occasions. We also had the 8 ( delicious) and bought some of the Blond (as well as the 8 and 10) to consume later.","Dec 12, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Washington,4.78/5,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a slightly hazy, very dark orange with a fine, one finger light khaki head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt, dried plums, raisins, dates and a hint of licorice. Flavor is caramel and biscuit malt, figs, dates, raisin bread and leather. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. Wow, finally got a bottle of this classic, a 2016 (bb 2019) bottling. I really wanted to try this next to a St. Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10, the latter my all time favorite quad and top rated beer all round. The best I could do to match the ages was a 2018 bottle of St. Bernardus and a 2013 bottle of Rochefort, but if not scientific, it will at least be enjoyable. I was actually expecting this to taste most like the St. Bernardus, because somewhere I read they used similar recipes. To my surprise, the Westy quite a different malt flavor, with some dry biscuit flavors (perhaps more date than biscuit) reminiscent of old ales melded to the brighter fruit I expected. Both the St. Bernardus and Rochefort had somewhat darker head color and a more reddish orange compared to the orange in the Westvleteren. The darkness of the rich colors and fine bubbles in the long lasting heads where similar in all three. Although the Rochefort has always won my side by side, this time I found the St. Bernardus to have brighter, more complex flavors. Perhaps the age mellowing has tempered the Rochefort too much (although I still have some older ones I find still enjoyable). As much as I love the classic dark fruit character of the St. Bernardus and Rochefort, I'm completely won over by the Westvleteren; it adds a malty depth to the fruit flavors that I find irresistible. I'm a skeptic and anything with a lot of hype combined with scarcity always make me prepared to be a bit underwhelmed, but in this case, I understand why this quad is so legendary. I would definitely be buying this regularly even if I had to drive to an abbey to buy it. A legendary classic that lives up to its reputation. I look forward to trying the Westvleteren 8 I picked up at the same time, although it is the same vintage and may not have held up as well.","Nov 13, 2022"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Massachusetts,4.56/5,"Best by 9/28/24, bottled 9/28/21

Here we are, review #1300!! For this milestone review, I obtained the absolutely legendary Westy 12, the highest rated Quad on BA and #46 overall. A long time want of mine (over 3 years), so I finally decided to pull the trigger and get some shipped from Belgium. This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple

Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine. The swallow brings notes of sweet booze, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, port wine, clove, baked apple, leather, and light tobacco

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes slightly with a huge complexity that dries over time

Wow. I just had to give this one a bump in the overall. So unique and ever changing, it’s addicting. I’m so happy I picked up a 6 pack of this whale, and happy to finally have it in the books","Sep 23, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Australia,4.7/5,"Found randomly in the fridge at Beer360 in Richmond, Australia in November 2021. The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were. I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer. The beer was drunk in April 2022.

In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour. There's a thin, off-white head. 

The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake. 

The taste is complex and ever-changing. There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off. There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange.

The mouthfeel is full and smooth.

Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA. It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer! Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it.

Cheers!","Aug 09, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,,4.94/5,"Amazing Quadrupel. If you cannot get your hands on it, just go with the St. Bernardus ABT.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Washington,4.68/5,"Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.

330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice. 

Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light. 

Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep. 

Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden. 

Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right. 

Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class. 
___________________________________________

Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:

Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)

330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.

Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.

Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.

This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.

(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)","Apr 07, 2022"

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Minnesota,4.93/5,"Bought by appointment at the monastery, a crate each of 12, 8 and blonde. The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise.","Mar 24, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Germany,4.62/5,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.","Jan 29, 2022"
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),,Nebraska,4.24/5,"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.

APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.

SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.

PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.

Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4

APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.

SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.

PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible.","Jan 16, 2022"

Double Citra®,,New York,5/5,"Double Citra pours a a hazy golden-yellow color with a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates into a faint foamy ring. This is what an IPA is supposed to look like! Strong hoppy aroma with notes of citrus, specifically grapefruit and orange, with hints of tropical fruit and pine. The aroma is fresh and intense, with a balanced bitterness and a slightly sweet finish. Another aspect that Hill Farmstead hit out of the park. Double Citra showcases the citrusy and tropical flavors of my favorite hop. The palate has a balanced bitterness with a strong hop profile of grapefruit, orange, and passion fruit. It also has a malty sweetness to support the hop flavor. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, which complements its juicy and hoppy flavor profile. The beer is medium to full-bodied, which gives it a satisfying and silky texture. The creamy mouthfeel helps to balance out the bitterness from the hops and the sweetness from the malt, resulting in a well-rounded and enjoyable drinking experience. I would describe the mouthfeel of Double Citra as velvety or luxurious. Overall, this magnificently crafted beer is an exemplar of the NEIPA category and I would rank it along side the finest offerings from the kings of the NEIPA style, Tree House.","Feb 05, 2023"

A delicate flower: so measured, seamlessly executed and well-balanced, it’s difficult to parse. 
Orange jellies, yeah, but leave it on the palate + it unfolds into orchard, tropical and flavours I don’t even associate with Citra. Lingers endlessly, shifting in tone and intensity.

Double Citra®,,Rhode Island,4.18/5,"16oz. Can served in a tulip. Pours a dull orange with a loose, 1/8th inch head, off-white head embedded with pinpricks and ringlets that quickly disperses into a thin, tight band around the shoulders. Clarity is slightly haze. Nose expresses bright notes of mandarin navel oranges and a hint of pith. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of light, crackery/biscuity malts.

S: Aromas of orange and lemon-lime, albeit faint.

T: Taste follows nose up front, remains in middle, then finishes with a nice dry bitterness.

F: Seems under carbonated and a bit flat.

O: Slightly off to the point that this may just be a bad can, at least by Hill Farmstead standards. Even so, the citrus flavor is well presented.","Aug 26, 2022"
Double Citra®,,Pennsylvania,4.51/5,"Dark gold clear pour from a can into a Willi - the best way to describe most HF IPAs is that they're just so clean, and balanced. Not an oversaturated mess like a lot of the beers coming out currently.

Moderate body (which is thinner than I expected from Hill Farmstead. The carbonation is elevated making the beer spritzy. The malt portion is lighter but lasts throughout the tasting.

Double Citra®,,Connecticut,4.4/5,"Canned on 10/6/21; consumed on 10/28/21

Pours an almost turbid golden burnt orange body capped with two fingers of lush, fluffy, white foam; good head retention yields a thin layer of cap, a hearty, expansive collar, and generous spread of webby/spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to deeply floral citrus refined to fresh orange juice accents and a fluffy lime underlay; papaya rind and soft melon ease over the middle as tinges of black peppercorn phased effortlessly into flaky, plush malt profile on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste shows mango upfront grazed with pineapple tart transitioning to lemon meringue against a fluffy malt base over the mid-palate; melon touches the back end, a briefly sweet interlude as musty grass and delicate, underripe passionfruit and grapefruit finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, dispersing a hoppy twang fusing to juiciness over the mid-palate; the back end highlights a zesty character invigorating a taut, drying finish.

Waves of stimulation texture effortlessly attenuated character, seeing a pillowy malt profile support zesty citrus and pangs of sweeter tropical nectar in playful contrast; common with Hill's DIPAs, stimulating yet universally approachable displays.","Oct 29, 2021"

Double Citra®,,Vermont,4.86/5,"L: Gorgeous cream hazy wheat. About 1/2 inch of frothy head with lacing that hangs on the side of the glass.

S: Aroma comes bounding out of the can. The Citra is overwhelming, in a good way. Stone fruit, papaya, ripe melon. Wow.

T: Citra at the front, leading to pine/resin, with sweet fruit here and there. Not an overwhelming alcohol-flavor either, despite the 8%

F: This is quite effervescent, with a peppery and dry finish. Just an absolutely perfect amount of carbonation - enough of a bite to notice, but also simultaneously juicy and mouth-watering.

O: This is a spectacular beer. What puts this double with Citra above many others is that it hits every piece perfectly - aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Many juicy IPAs pack in the aroma or flavor, but really miss with the high alcohol content and mouth feel and either come off as too strong, or flat. I grabbed this at the brewery today in a can and was so excited to have it - I'm looking forward to having it again once things open up a bit and growlers are back.

Great take on Citra hops and have one more to try this weekend.","Sep 04, 2020"
Double Citra®,,Vermont,4.5/5,"L: Hazy yellow with hints of orange, creamy white head and good lacing.

S: At first right after I poured, fairly subdued. But after I took a few sips the aroma opened up to reveal dank pine, juicy citrus, mango, and peachy esters. The malt is very subdued, but contributes a bready background.

T: Very mild bitterness upfront, instant waves of juicy mango, orange, pine resin, and peach. Very complex hop flavor for a single hop beer. The malt provides a bready base with a touch of sweetness that just balances out the bitterness.

F: Very creamy, dry.

Overall: A beer that took a second to get going for me, but by the end of the glass was savoring every last sniff and sip! Such a wonderful showcase of the citra hop and whatever glorious yeast strain Hill Farmstead is using.","Aug 26, 2020"
Double Citra®,,Nevada,4.71/5,"Well damn, I thought the 6 pack of their Mosaic IPA was the bees knee's but holy moly this stuff. . . had it on tap at a bar in Vermont, not during our trip to the brewery.

Pours the most beautiful hazy ipa, looks like orange juice, this even surpasses the prettiest Tree House stuff, which also impressed me on how well it did with a relatively ugly style of beer. 1"" of white head on an orange juice like body. Keeping up with the orange theme, the nose is all citra orange and tangerine. Where it gets wild, is as great smelling as this is, its the low point for this beer. Plenty of beers smell like awesome citrus. 

Taste, jeez man. You know, if this was a lot more available, we could be flirting with a perfect 5 for taste. Truly separates itself as there isn't an acidic hop burn anywhere in the taste/mouthfeel like you get with ipas that are ""very good"". Its the best version of a hazy ipa I've ever had. Smooth, yet dry, has the best of both worlds much like the Van Halen song. I don't need complexity, just give me some awesome hop notes pushing orange and tangerine all day with a lower, yet firm bitterness and an amazing crushability notwithstanding somehow this is 8% abv. You can get wrecked on this effortlessly.","Apr 29, 2020"

Beer opens rich milk chocolate, hazelnut, and mocha coffee. Layers of molasses, vanilla, and lactose in the middle. More chocolate, hazelnut, and pancake syrup in the back.

The taste is super sweet. Not really picking up the bourbon nor coffee that much but the butteriness of the coconut is present as/is sweet chocolate and the hazelnut. A very good big stout.

Ann,,New York,4.95/5,Fantastic,"Jun 29, 2023"
Ann,,New York,4.84/5,"2015 batch, which I think is batch #3. Bottle pour from Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro, VT.

This one pours a fairly clear golden orange color, with a small head, and a bit of lacing.

This smells like lemon peel, tea, honey, grassy funk, white wine, pear skin, melon, Riesling, and a minerally funk.

This is my biggest white whale, the beer I have most wanted to try since first trying Hill Farmstead originally 10 years ago. It’s tremendous, just about as good as it gets for saison, but, it wasn’t even the best beer I had from Hill Farmstead on my recent trip. That’s how high the bar is for this long-time favorite brewery of mine. This has soft, subtle, and richly complex flavor to it. There’s the obvious honey, almost like honey-soaked pears, or something like that, with white wine, Riesling grapes, melon, apricot jam, and a floral and minerally funk. All of these flavor descriptions make it seem like it’s a super strong and intense beer – it really isn’t. It’s really delicate, and rewards slower sipping and enjoying.

This is light bodied, soft, almost creamy, with a wonderful drinkability. It’s well carbonated, but in a subtle way.

This might not be the exact top of the mountain for Hill Farmstead – that’s probably Samuel, or one of the SARA Residency beers. But this is pretty close to the top, and a perfect expression of an already great beer in Anna.","May 31, 2023"
Ann,,Colorado,4.27/5,On Tap at Finley's Pub in Denver. Very good for the Style,"Mar 24, 2023"
Ann,,Connecticut,4.55/5,"Bottled in 2017; consumed at the brewery on 2/8/2023

Pours a nearly crystal-clear, pale gold body capped with a fluffy finger and a half of eggshell-white foam, receding expeditiously to a paper-thin layer of fuzzy cap, a thin, soapy collar and the seldom few strands of lacing holding briefly to the walls of the glass.

Aroma is clean, vinous, and supremely ripe, highlighting a white wine contrast to waxy honey alongside a white tea florality; rustic funk is delicate as docile oak prickles the bouquet in tune with an increasingly focused white wine clarity.

Taste presents a white wine-forward opening soon awash in clean minerals and gentle oak before a milky funk peaks over the mid-palate; spring pastures and a general earthiness persists while a distant honey imbuement lingers over time.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body and a steady ease of moderate carbonation, a taut texture finding transitional wetness while remaining resoundingly delicate on the tongue as the finish reveals a glossy, supremely tempered twang.

An elegant, near dreamlike attenuation found at the apotheosis of the Hill blending program, delivering pastoral context thread through the deliberately silken gossamer of a gentler, American-styled saison; a level of reverence achieved through outright purity of form.","Feb 08, 2023"
Ann,,Massachusetts,4.61/5,"Onsite pour. I really wanted to dislike this but it was indeed pretty sublime. By and large this is Anna, but the honey notes really come through here, with a diminished funk and acidity. Bit of leafy bitterness in the flavors, and definitely lots of white oak -- perhaps more than any beer I've had before. Almost dusty. Main thing driving down the overall is the price and availability; while this is quite excellent, it is not the be-all and end-all of beer and instead falls in line with many of the other wine barrel aged HF offerings. Coincidentally, this is also the review that makes me a ""poo bah"" on this site. Feels like an appropriate occasion to be enjoying this

Ann,,Florida,4.02/5,"Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. The nose is somewhat bland with barrel highlights. Real smooth with good carbonation. Light citrus and orange notes with floral/herbal and woody undercurrents. To be honest, after all the hype, I was expecting a whole lot more.....","Apr 30, 2021"
Ann,,Ohio,4.52/5,"My long time white whale, we meet at last...

As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.

The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time.

Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right.

Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley!

---

Arriving on this fine autumn afternoon on Wednesday October 12th, 2022 after a leisurely hike at Long Pond behind Hill's property (the one you see in the aerial snaps), I wouldn't have dared to presume that the likes of Ann 2015 would be pouring from beautifully basket-nestled, honey-waxed bottles. I may have exhausted the remainder of good my luck for many years to come with this one.

Pouring a finely hazy pale amber with a bubbly head dying to a thin ring, this vintage is unexpectedly oaky, particularly compared to my memory of 2019 Ann. It's got toasty, almost hickory qualities within the wood veins, while the acidity is very mild, like kumquat. The finish is bone dry, exhaling the same mild bleu funk found in the nose. When my partner mentions notions of pizza crust (and no, we haven't eaten yet today), I take that under consideration upon subsequent sips and actually detect characteristics of oregano and sundried tomato.

While an unbelievable fortuitous experience, and a beautiful beer in its own right, this was not quite the stellar experience I was expecting. At the same time, I'd rate it right around the same as I did in 2019, so I'm not adjusting my score here. That said, I hate to look a gift horse in the mouth, but I wish I had gotten a whack at Art this week. It's especially bittersweet to know that the next week's patrons actually did!","Oct 07, 2019"
Ann,,Massachusetts,4.65/5,"Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow.","Sep 26, 2018"
Ann,,Canada (ON),4.83/5,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach.

Ann,,Rhode Island,4.75/5,"Batch 4, 375mL bottle served into a bulb glass onsite 4/18/18. 

First half of pour was crystal clear golden body, second half was slightly hazy and a bit more orange. Good two finger white head that sticks around for a while. 

Aroma – I didn’t smell these all at once, I don’t even think that would be humanly possible, but noted them as it warmed and developed in the glass over a half hour or so. Honey. Lemongrass. Nectar. A delicate woodiness. Floral. Vanilla. Cedar. That musty, herbal smell when you walk into an old country store. Grassy. Hay. Pine cones. White wine. Potpourri. Fresh spring day frolicking through a meadow of hay. 

On the tongue it’s big but soft, delicate citrus and lemongrass, tart lactic and white wine, lightly funky with oak and a bit of mustiness. Honey comes through on the finish. Not overly dry but not sweet either. Lightly carbed with a very drinkable body.

T: Hints at a subtle tartness and sweetness, while being earthy floral, and fruity. More funk, brett and barrel character, as one reads into it and lets it sit. Notes correspond to the aroma, and bring forth honey, oak, grain/hay, lemon, and citrus

L-slight haze, bright lemon gold with a white head

Smell and taste follow each other which is best stated as ""complex"". The honey and lemon come through nicely just like Anna and there's a nice tartness added as well. The wine barrel is prevalent and adds a nice level of bitterness and oak. I would have guessed a subtle red wine barrel, but it seems more like chardonnay is the likely barrel used. Makes perfect sense. Earthiness and floral tones were present as well and the overall lingering unique note was something either cinnamon or comparable to it. It was really incredible within everything else in this beer.

Ann,,Vermont,4.49/5,"2014 Vintage from the taproom. Finally got to have the beer I have most coveted since I started visiting the enchanted beer mecca in 2013 and have proceeded to make the trek once a month since. All the trips finally paid off as it was there for on-site consumption. Had side by side with Le Sarrasin and Being and Time which might have thrown off the overall ranking. This was smooth as silk, fluffy clouds, extremely pleasant with where the base honey beer accentuated the wine barrel. The smell wasn't over powering, or super aromatic to me. A little bit of funk, don't know if that had to do with it being a 14. Once again the feel was the crazy thing to me and defintley stood out. It was super drinkable and if this was a beer I could have on a regular basis to have with dinner it would be amazing. I have to say that there was something tin the way Le Sarrasin finished that I like it better.

Ann,,Vermont,4.65/5,"The 2014 vintage, poured on-site at the Hill Farmstead taproom. 

L: Golden copal pour with medium head and lacing. 

S: Virtually everything on the top half of the bottle pour is wine and barrel. The bottom half of the bottle opens up with floral notes, some honey, a little citrus, and subtle funk. 

T: Wine barrels up front, followed by tart citrus flavors and some earthy/floral notes, finishing with honey and a touch of lingering bitterness

F: Soft, juicy, and dry on the end. 

O: I had waited over two years to try this beer, with unrealistically high expectations, so I was slightly disappointed when I finally had a pour of Ann and did not have the ""life-altering, 5-out-of-5, this is the best beer in the world"" experience. 

I have had this beer three times now. Ann is a fantastic beer but not worthy of its hype. To me, it fails to break the Hill Farmstead Top Five.","Aug 05, 2016"
Ann,,Florida,4.49/5,"Nice subtle honey without being overly sweet, and very smooth to drink. Of course its delicious but it wasn't quite the world breaker I was expecting. Definitely don't pass on it, but there are IMO much better beers to trade half your cellar away for.","Jul 20, 2016"
Maman,,Missouri,4.43/5,"Pours jet black with a still, no foam look. Heavy oily legs cling to the glass after the lightest of swirls. It looks like motor oil that's been run hard through a motor for ten thousand miles - thick, dark, and viscous. Aroma pushes dark fruits, plum, and chocolate across the nose first. Char, barrel, bourbon, and hearty roasty and toasty malts sit behind. Dark fruits is the dominate note, at least, immediately out of the fridge. Mild brownie shows up as the beer warms. Flavor profile is dark fruits, caramel, toffee, tobacco, raisins, fig, plum, and chocolate. The blend of notes conjours up thoughts of barleywines, but retains heavy stout notes via late roasty and toasty malts. Bourbon, barrel, and char are all present to varying degrees, molding into the 14.6% ABV well. Brownie and more chocolate start to show up as the beer warms, masking some of hte initial dark fruit notes. It really develops a wonderful depth to the flavor profile after a fairly simplistic aroma. Mouth feel is thick and viscious, but with an otherwise flat and still effervescence. Overall, a blend of hearty stout and barleywine notes. It has a lot of dark fruits for a heavy stout, but despite that, retains a good balance despite being in wine alcohol territory. Massive slug, so -0.25 from overall.

Maman,,New York,4.86/5,"'20 batch. 

Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke.

This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here. 

This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this.

It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially.","Feb 22, 2021"
Maman,,Illinois,5/5,"I have to say I was blown away by the flavors in this. Deep dark fudge bourbon goodness. It’s a showcase of what the barrel alone can bring to the party. And what a party it is. Thick. Velvet smooth, vanilla, chocolate swirl. Wonderful.","Jan 21, 2021"

Aroma has layers of varied chocolate forms including sweet fudge, bittersweet baking cocoa and dark chocolate. Roasted malts, some dark fruit and a hint of boozy barrel.

Roasty and rich, loads of chocolate, smooth boozy barrel flavor melds perfectly with the brew. Earthy wood layer, some earthy and floral vanilla, sweet toffee. Sweetness and dark fruits come out more clearly as it nears room temperature.

Doubleganger,,Tennessee,4.27/5,"Fresh cans from Sandwich, enjoyed on Cape Cod and back home in Nashville.

Glowing orange-gold body of haze and near-murk — pure juice. Big head of compact, off-white bubbles. Absolutely scoopable and creamy looking. Fantastic lacing.

Heavy sweet tropical fruits on the nose, balanced with lovely floral and herbal notes, breadiness, and a slight bite of pine. Familiar Juicy Fruit characteristics of a big TH hazy, but also a yeasty element. Each whiff is a little different than the last.

Taste follows on the very front of the sip but is then overwhelmed by a starchy green element, which takes it down several notches. Still heavy tropical fruit, very juicy, with a nice semi-sweetness. The grassiness overshadows any breadiness or pine characteristics that might be present. The can describes a sharp but pleasant finish, which I was hoping meant a nice bitterness. But this is more of a sharp green, chalky note that steels from the experience.

Feel is velvety soft and wonderfully coating.","Jul 06, 2022"

$20.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a more intense version of their ""doppelganger"". An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins. This one is really nicely balanced.

Doubleganger,,Germany,4.68/5,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy and stable white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

Smell: A combination of ripe orange and tropical mango and pineapple. Hoppy, dank and sweet. A bit sharp.

Taste: Citrusy notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit with subtle tropical hints. Not as sweet es the smell suggests. Zesty, bitter and slightly sharp.

Feel: Very juicy. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.

Overall: Even though smell and look were almost perfect right from the beginning, it took a bit for the taste to fully develop. A bit too green and bitter when cold, it developed into a smooth and nicely balanced juice with just the right amount of everything. One of the best Tree House beers I've had so far.","Apr 25, 2022"

Doubleganger,,New Jersey,4.33/5,"Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21)","Aug 30, 2021"

Fuzzy,,Illinois,4.55/5,"I'm finding I am really enjoying white peaches specifically in wild ales, just lend themselves to barrel, funk and botanicals so well. Here SP has done well to allowing the juicy peach tones shine too. Smell is damn impressive: sour peach, yogurt, barnyard, and barrel funks, bright and rustic oak, pressed flowers, dry earth, a touch of lemon and lime zest, and finished with big hay. Taste is more sour and less complex with funk losing the barrel variety to the sour fruits, otherwise the same with sneaky complexity yet potent. Feel is sour and decently acidic, but gentle, dries out with various funks, almost feels more pungent than it tastes or smells. Clear yellow body with a pinky finger of white foam.

Fuzzy,,Massachusetts,4.49/5,"2022 vintage

Here we are, the #1 Wild Ale on BA for my 1500th review! This is a special one that has been a long time want for me, so I’m very excited to finally try it. I’ve only had a few Side Project beers, but they’ve all been fantastic so I have no reason to think this one wouldn’t be. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy pale gold with 2 fingers of whitehead that quickly fades to a ring and leaves no lacing

This is certainly tart in the nose, but it has a surprisingly nice balance to it. I'm picking up on aromas of tart peach, lemon yogurt, sharp oak, tannic white wine, straw, bready malt, wildflower honey, apple skin, light vinegar, stone, and even a touch of smoke

In taste it starts off with a balanced tartness similar to the aroma, and on the back end explodes with an aggressive flash of tartness before settling down once again. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting jammy peach, lemon juice, vanilla, wet hay, straw, smooth oak, leather, and white grape. The swallow brings notes of tart peach, lemon juice, crabapple, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, wet hay, vanilla, bready malt, and light peat smoke

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a puckering beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time

Oh yeah, this is damn good. Despite the not so good looks, everything else here is awesome. A truly unique beer","Jan 26, 2023"

Fuzzy,,New Jersey,4.15/5,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance 

S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition","Nov 08, 2021"

A nice juicy fruit sort of tropical character and some nice grass and damp wood funk.","Feb 05, 2021"

Fuzzy,,South Carolina,4.48/5,"375mL bottle into a Teku
Blend 4 (aka Vintage 2020)

A: Pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months. Several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom. Color is apricot yellow/orange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously. Once that’s gone it actually looks flat. It’s quite hazy, nearly opaque. Certainly not much of a looker. 

S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot. Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose. A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out. 

T: Taste is very delicious. Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness. Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice. Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic. 

M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good.

O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt. Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high. Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon. Regardless, still a treat, and would happily drink any day of the week. 

Happy New Year BA’s!

Fuzzy,,Massachusetts,4.32/5,"Beautiful looking beer, pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin, under-ripe white peach flesh, lemony acidity, and a hint of peach rings and oak. the nose on this is really wonderful.

wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ... I tend to prefer more subtle and delicate examples of the style. As I finished the bottle I thought well this was good but I would have been fine with 8oz, which is something I have never said after drinking a 375mL of world class fruited mixed ferm.","Oct 29, 2020"

Fuzzy,,Maine,4.39/5,"Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy 

Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F.

Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25

Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart.

Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean.

Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point.","Oct 20, 2020"

S: Peaches, tart, funk. 
T: peachy goodness. A little funk. A little sweet. A lot of sour. Almost like sour candy. Some notes of lime, vanilla, oak, barn.

Fuzzy,,Massachusetts,4.29/5,"Moderately hazy golden orange body. Not a particularly long lasting or fluffy head despite the robust effervescence. Huge aromatics -- akin to Cantillon Fou Foune -- of overripe peach, apricot, fruit leather, tropical fruits, acidic lacto character, some barrel. Flavors are hugely tart, perhaps a bit heavy-handed, with a crisp and refreshing body. Definitely a sharing beer, I split a 750ml between 7 people and felt that I had just enough and any more would have been overwhelming. A solid wild for sure, but lacking the subtle funky complexity of, say, a good Belgian lambic or a Hill Farmstead barrel aged mixed fermentation ale.

Poured clear gold with a nice white head that settled out with a little white head remaining around the edges. Smelled tart and slightly acidy. Taste was the same but not as in your face as I had expected (this was my first Side Project beer). Mouthfeel was about right with the medium pucker and quench. Really enjoyed this - reminded me someway of Fou Foune even though that one is apricots. Cheers!","Jan 21, 2020"
Fuzzy,,Washington,4.67/5,"Very similar to Smooth. 

Differences 

Light color from the white peaches 

Nose is more delicate. Definite peach aroma. 

Taste follows the Bose. More delicate flavor that allows the base beer to be more cohesive with the peaches instead of a punch of nectarines. Also slightly more acidic

Feel is also more delicate 

Overall, this is a more delicate, better balanced beer than smooth. If you like a more fruit forward beer, smooth is where it is at. However the nuance of fuzzy is fantastic. You get more of the base beer, and more of that great Missouri micro Flora.","Apr 15, 2019"
Fuzzy,,Germany,4.35/5,"Pours a clouded amber to orange color with a fizzy, small head, which immediately diminishes to a small coating.

Smells of leaf wrapped ripe peaches, offering a bright fruitiness, which comes close to actually cut a peach into half and enjoy its aromas. This inherits not only the fruit‘s pulp but also its stone pith quality, adding a soft soothing quality to the sprizzy, slightly perfumy and floral fruits.

Has a higher, finely nuanced carbonation, with an effervescent finish, among a lighter, yet versatile and intense lighter body.

While this is doubtlessly focussed entirely on peaches, the flavors of the beer offer an initial mineralic quality, white bread dough and matured, still slightly bitter herbs. Peaches enter the palate with an early fruit sugar peak, which stays till the end, but fades down slowly and constantly. The fruit itself is defined by a pleasant tartness, sweeter peach pulp, a light moldy touch among a flowery mildness, which allows a rustic barnyard profile, consisting of leather and cream cheese, to cut through. Develops an almost creamy finish with an astonishing smoothness of the fruits and a finely beaded mouthfeel, leading to a surprising, well interweaved juiciness, in which the maintaining tartness manages to shine. 

This tastes great, everything comes together perfectly, due to the beer‘s awesome mouthfeel and balance. It is just as complex as a Lambic with a cleverly integrated tartness, labeling this unmistakably a sour, but with a complexity which assures to be able to pick up the beer‘s subtle nuances.","Nov 12, 2018"

Look: A hazy orange with a very thin white head that dissipates quickly. 

Smell: Sweet and fresh nectarine hits the nose immediately. This fades into a buttery oak with some hay like funk. A little salty and mildly acidic. 

Taste: Nectarine juice shocks the palate that fades to a buttery oak. This is punched aside by a lightly briny sour note that fades to more nectarine stone fruit notes on the finish. 

Feel: Bright, clean, mildly acidic. No alcohol noted. Light carbonation.

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt

Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night","Sep 10, 2022"

Nectarine Premiere,,Colorado,4.45/5,"this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile, so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share, what a gem! its as good as i hoped it would be, the nectarine popping in here, natural and juicy, the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver, and it seems right in its peak, bottle from september 2020. pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle, very fizzy but not holding a ton of head, and a nose that my mouth is still watering from, wow its puckery, nectarous, and juicy, ripe and sweet and sour at the same time, wood heavy, fully wild, incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms, more fruit, more funk, more wood. the flavor is fantastic, the fruit hits mostly at the end, its mature vinous funky wild beer up front, slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here, pils malt, doughy and crackery and simple but earthy. the ferment is sharp but not overly sour, tannic from the oak, maybe some white wine character too, lots of well developed bretty funk too. when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine, and it stays on the tongue through the finish. impressively real, forward, and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet, amazing. this has already developed well in the bottle, but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further. its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers, but the fruit element is as good as it gets. great carbonation here too, lively and excited feeling on the palate, fits the summery fruitiness. loved this, very thankful! i know this is one of their highest rated beers, but its probably not even in my top five from them, amazing as it is...

edit: got to drink on a bottle from october 2022 this weekend, as good as i remember it being, shocking how not sour this is, smells acidic but is more funk than acid by a mile, but less fermentation driven than a lot of their beer. the nectarine is sweet and pure, and there is no confusing it with a peach or an apricot or anything, its pure nectarine in its full glory. i have rarely paired de garde beers with heady food, opting to enjoy them in insolation so as not to distract or detract, but this was epic with spice asian flavors, cool combination. love this one and there is definitely enough batch variance in my experience for each release to be worth seeking out!","Oct 06, 2021"

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; a touch of warmth in the gullet

Overall: I get the reputation of Hill Farmstead and I have had some very good beers from them; I just don't think this is a top notch English barleywine; I like the dark fruit element (and that is creative) but this needs some hop tones to balance the sweetness - not American over the top hops; just some English hops and toffee to be more authentic to the style","Nov 25, 2020"
Aaron,,Maine,4.63/5,"It's finally about to happen... Years I've dreamed about this bottle. Years it has eluded me. Now, on my birthday evening, I'm staring face-to-face with Aaron - preparing to crack him open. 

I'm ready

2015 Vintage - Bottled May, 2017 - poured into a shifter at 45°F.

Pours out with a glug, glug, glug, sitting a ruddy, rusty red-brown hue - cloudy, but does let some light in. A partial loose tan head bubbles, before quickly dissipating to a thin tan collar. 4.5

Nose: As soon as the cap came off, the aroma filled the room. English barleywine to a T. Sweet malt, raisins, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, Werther's Originals, leather, varnish, maple, cherry wood, pecan, maraschino cherries, candied dates, black grape, prune, and a kiss of molasses, all wrapped up into splintery white oak, with a beautiful bourbon presence, lending vanilla, and more caramel. A whisper of roast, some musty old rackhouse, and age. Time. Maturity. 4.5

Palate: Aaron greets the palate with a big sweet hug of toffee, caramel, date, dried fig, dried cherry, raisin, vanilla, plum, pecan, and maple. Rich, decadent, and bold, yet not cloying, as a second wave with oak, bourbon, and tons of dark fruit washes in and cuts into the sweetness. The dark fruit is very prominent, lending a subtle fruity tart kiss, which is crucial to providing balance. A round, malty nuttiness follows, with pecan, walnut, and that almost fatty element to them. The woody oak presence grows, and with it, some malted milk, vanilla creme, and just a dusting of cocoa, before the bourbon finally emerges, flowing into the finish - dry now, with splintery white oak and just a shadow of barrel char. 

Mouthfeel/Body: This is near-perfection. Aaron is rich, luscious, smooth, thick, and a bit viscous, yet avoids ever being syrupy, cloying, or overbearing. The oak and dark fruit brightness cut in just enough to thin it out, and the 9% ABV ensures it isn't pure glue, but worlds away from thin. Restrained, but respectable effervescence for the age, size, and style, and finishes with an incredible oaky dryness. 

Overall: Aaron is the number one rated English barleywine on BeerAdvocate, and for good reason - however, this goes beyond superficial ratings. Hill Farmstead instills magic in all of their hoppy and farmhouse ales, and Aaron is no exception. It's a beer with an identity, from a brewery with an identity. I'm not sure you could brew a better English barleywine if you tried. Yes, Aaron is hard to get, but if you can get him fairly, you'll be rewarded.","Oct 21, 2020"

Aaron,,Colorado,4.55/5,"a near perfect example of an english barleywine, this one aged two years in bourbon barrels and also bottle conditioned. its the saisons and wild beers that get all the attention from these guys, but this is as good as anything else in the game in this style, and seems gentler, more subtle, and more mature and drinkable than other over the top, barrel heavy offerings with lots of residual sugar, firestone walker comes to mind there, this is just a wonderful cold weather sipper, and honestly the essence of the style as far as i am concerned, big thanks to my buddy for sharing this one (among many others), in an epic session over the weekend, i have been wanting to try this forever. this has a deep matte mahogany color to it, a tall tan head creamy and thick, and no visible sediment at all, looks well cleaned up and mature. the aroma is rich barley malt, some sweet long boiled and toffee character to it, chestnut, maple, and toasted bread. its immediately not that sweet, full of earthiness, and enormously layered. the bourbon has some vanilla and honey notes going on, but doesnt interfere with the base beer, it enhances, sweet oak in the mix as well, raisin, and fig. the flavor is amazing, really about the barley malt, very enlgish to me, no hops at all, maybe some maris otter in here with some darker crystal, definitely a concentrated richness to it without decadent sweetness weighing it down, and the booziness is minimal for the style, although this is a bit lower anyway, i like it not being a focal point in the taste. the bourbon and oak are smooth and not too forward, and there is a wonderful depth and body to this, better and better as it warms too. the perfect balance of all the elements here, some yeast character through most of it, and a curiously clean finish for the style. near perfection here, no frills barleywine as it should be. a wonderful drinking experience!","Dec 19, 2019"
Aaron,,Minnesota,4.13/5,"Huge thanks to bigda83 for this 500ML bottle that I’ve been lusting after for many gnat lifetimes. Bottled July 11th, 2018. 

The bottle says share…I’m not doing that. The pour is a dark red mixed with dark brown, with the overall impression being dark. The nose is unexpectedly light: bits of caramel, toffee, brown sugar, & half a rack of bourbon, which is the only thing that comes on strong. 

Maybe if I tell people my new kid is named Aaron, they’ll send me more of this. Because it’s pretty good. First off, it’s like being beaten about the tongue & gums with a wooden stave that’s brushed past a nice bourbon. Big, big wood with minor bourbon. The other main players are rich brown sugar, toffee, along with smoke-tinged maple & just a touch of booze. Exceedingly smooth & sweet. 500ML is the correct serving size for this baseball player. 

So glad I finally had the opportunity to try this. It didn’t lead up to the legendary hype, but it’s an excellent beer that deserves to be in the top echelon of barleywines.","Sep 24, 2019"
Aaron,,South Carolina,4.93/5,"Appearance - Pours muddy brown with a nice fluffy tan head that quickly settles to a rocky ring. No lacing.

Bottled April 2014 
Poured into a snifter

A- pours a deep brown color, nearly opaque, with a one-finger foamy off-white head that has short retention before settling into a ring around the glass

S- The two years in a bourbon barrel is immediately noticed, as there is a huge oaky bourbon note on the nose, as well as barrel juice, caramel and woody vanilla. Beyond the barrel, notes of the base beer start to poke through; raisins, figs & maraschino cherries, as well as brown sugar, molasses & pipe tobacco. Undertones of port wine and fruitcake 

T- initial taste is a wave of caramel and toffee, mixed with a bold, yet not overpowering, barrel note; plenty of bourbon with a peppery oak note mixes with a charge of dark fruit notes of rum soaked raisin & fig, followed by black strap molasses, cola and caramelized brown sugar. Mid-palate adds an earthy tobacco note, and starts to bring out sweet notes of sherry and port wine. The finish adds one more kick of barrel, with undertones of vanilla and coconut, lingers of caramel and dark fruits 

M- thick body with moderate carbonation leads to a thick and creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety, silky, slightly warming finish 

O- this one just gets better as I drink it, the standard bearer for the style, just outstanding","Aug 28, 2019"

Aaron,,New Hampshire,4.52/5,"So wow, honestly one the finest BA Barleywines I have every had.... Poured into a 13 oz Game Of Thrones Glass aged for 2 years in bourbon barrels bottled in the last two months. Pours a gorgeous chestnut with a 2 plus finger off white head that leaves a few thin wisps of lace. 4.75

Smell starts with Oaked woody bourbon, chestnut, vanilla, toffee, caramel, dates, hard cider, and a little more booze that tickles and warms the nose. 4.5

Taste follows bold vanilla bourbon, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, nutty, biscuity grain, and again the warming booze shows up and warms me belly! 4.5

Mouthfeel is rather large, creamy with gentle carbonation, slightly dry in the finish, and I assume this is around 11.5 or 12% ABV, but the bottle doesn’t list, dipper for sure but because of its complexity pretty easy sipping. 4.5

Overall one of if not the greatest BA Barleywine I have had the pleasure of drinking, wowza and cheers! 4.5","May 19, 2019"
Aaron,,Maryland,5/5,"Had on tap at HFB after bottle run. Absolutely extraordinarily perfect high octane version of a English Barleywine. Had a beautiful if brief light tan head; excellent residual lacing. Rich tawny orange- ruby accented color. Like a beautiful piece teak. Both simple and then complex to light.
Nose was rich with toffee/caramel; wood; vanilla; soft herbal flower and bitterness. Taste magnified all these and slowly revealed tannins; slight hints of licorice; apple; and allspice as it warmed. Sweetness but never candy or cloying. Traces of whiskey helped round out flavors but well in background.
Feel was luxuriantly soft and smooth; very mildly dense like young port but never thick or distracting. 
Oh and $4 for 4oz glass???? 
Absurdly good beer and very accessible cost.
Barreled EBW is one of my favorite styles ... and Aaron is without question the best I’ve ever had.
Masterpiece.","May 19, 2019"
Aaron,,Massachusetts,4.7/5,"Bottle. I have been waiting for this bitch for ages. I tried both the 2016 & 2018 batches. This was one of my biggest wants because I figured Hill Farmstead does everything else great, I bet they would nail a Barleywine as well. Oh, and it is barrel aged for like an eon. Aaron pours a dark brown. Not necessarily clear bodied behind the tint of the beer. A thin, defeated ring of diminutive bubbles rest steadily around the outer conversion of beer and glass; the only thing minute about this beer. The aroma rises out of the glass like a slothful perfume. Thick, damp whiffs of bourbon, raisins, toffee, and dessert wine. Detailed, rich, royal. The flavor marches in line with the nose. Heavy, sweet, and decadent. I think the older batch has a bit more complexity but lacks the barrel character of it's newer kin. I get some flavors of boozy dates and maple syrup from both, though. Of course the feel stands abreast with the other elements of the beer. Portly, heavy, and warming. Toothsome but intense. Definitely lived up to the hype I personally gave this beer. The best Barleywine I have ever had.","Mar 25, 2019"
Aaron,,Ohio,4.32/5,"Opaque chestnut brown with a moderate fuzzy tan blanket that slowly settles to the thinnest ring and a smooth slick surface. A tilt leaves an impressive span of clear legs on the glass.

The aroma has swirls of vanilla and caramel, even as the glass sits further away. Coming in close, charred oak and aged date pair with toffee and a distinctly maple-esque bourbon warmth.

Taste is just as sweet and decadent as the nose sounds. Belly warming caramel frosting is lifted by Jack and Coke--it sounds odd and maybe off-putting, but it's light on the palate, helping its drinkability. Heavier notes of dark fruit and vanilla marshmallow fluff are again countered by sweet, light and even floral fig, which all begins to transform into fresh coconut on the exhale, especially as it warms.

Tingly and even crisp, the medium body is really easy to drink for a big burly barleywine. It's even inexplicably fleeting, disappearing into a slightly numbing, lightly sticky, semi-dry finish, leaving you desperately craving another swig. Obviously, I like this a lot, but at the same time, feel like I can't quite grasp it. There's something unsatisfying that leaves you wanting, and maybe that's the beauty of it.","Jan 16, 2019"
Aaron,,Canada (QC),4.75/5,"A: Pours a deep murky brown color with a beige colored head. Head is somewhat creamy, has very decent volume considering the aging done on this beer but dissipates quite quickly to a ring.

S: This beer really needs to not be ice cold for the nose to open. Still, it's pretty faint. There are notes of leather, peacans, vanilla, pepper, oak, caramel and light smoke. Quite a bit of raisins, dates and figs and maybe even dried apricot? Very nice and coherent but pretty low on intensity. 

T: What it lacks in smell intensity, it fucking gives back in taste. Jesus this beer is insane. It's insanely tasty with a ton of raisins, figs, dates and yes dried apricots. You have a ton of caramel, toffee, vanilla, smoke, very smooth oak, light pepper, super strong vanilla, leather and peacans. It's insanely complex and incredibly coherent. If I could give this beer a 6 I would. Taste wise, it has NO faults (enough for me to give a 5 on its own) and is absolutely spectacular in the mouth with its intensity of flavors while still being very drinkable.
EDIT: Saw someone somewhere say this beer had creme brulee notes and I agree 100%. There is a definite lactose like creaminess in the flavors that are very much there.

M: This is quite heavy but not too much surprisingly. Very smooth, creamy and not sticky at all. Absolutely perfect for the genre.

O: Man I can't say enough about this beer. I haven't been this impressed by a beer in at least 7 years (it was Cantillon Saint-Lamvinus). It's very intense in flavors, it's extremely complex and still very coherent (high complexity beers sometimes have flavors that don't complement each others this well). It's easily my favorite beer of all time as it is one of my favorite genres and by far the best executed beer of the genre I have the pleasure to taste. 

It was a very expensive beer at something like 35 USD, but it was well worth it to me. If I can find it again, I WILL buy at least 4 bottles. This beer commands your time and full attention. IMO, this is white whale worthy status.","Dec 10, 2018"
Aaron,,Indiana,4.68/5,"Pours thick to a teku, nearly-opaque dark brown with ruby highlights. Half a finger of head, with a persistent thick dusting that lingers around the rim and is revitalized by swirling. Redolent on the nose, vanilla and brown sugar with bourbon spice on top.

Aaron,,Massachusetts,4.59/5,"4 oz. onsite, ""2015 Aaron""

Nice deep maple-syrup color in the glass, small ring of foam clings where the liquid meets the edge of the glass. 

Nose isn't huge but I'm getting primarily caramel/burnt sugar, dark stone fruits, something resembling maple syrup, but couldn't find the bourbon.

Each sip starts with toffee, rock candy, sweet syrup, ending on something I wanna say is almost like black tea, with a little smidge of alcohol to cut through the sweetness. Again to my surprise not much in the way of bourbon, but I honestly think it was better for that. 

Little carb, sticky and coats the tongue but nothing big or overwhelming, and sweetness is always pleasant and never cloying.

Overall can't think of a single better barleywine I've had. Held in especially high contrast against a very bitter/medicinal/cough syrupy barleywine I'd picked up from a bottle shop the day before. Finishing this pour only renewed my efforts to try to land a bottle, definitely don't pass this one up if one comes your way.","Oct 26, 2018"

Bottled On Date: 02.03.2021

Glass: Snifter
ABV: 12%
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy light brown head. The head dissipates to a thick ring and thin cover. The lacing is good.

Smell: 
A goodly amount of semi-sweet chocolate combine with bittersweet chocolate and some coffee. Light notes of vanilla. A touch of oak and bourbon.

Taste: 
Follows the nose but with the coffee more pronounced and noticeable as are the bourbon notes. An earthy note shows up after mid-sip and lingers into the aftertaste alongside the coffee. Nicely balanced and not cloying. The alcohol can be noticed a bit and provides a nice warming sensation.

Feel: 
Smooth, silky and mouth-coating. Noticeable warmth from the alcohol. The body is medium-full.

Overall: 
An excellent Imperial Stout and a great sipper. Complex but not overly so. Very well done. The unintended 2 years in the cellar may have led to a reduction in the coffee and some of the bourbon and the barrel but this is still a tremendous beer. For what this beer is (a 12% coffee/chocolate/barrel ages IS) it is insanely drinkable.","Feb 07, 2023"
KBS,,South Carolina,4.19/5,Not the same...,"Jan 22, 2023"
KBS,,Pennsylvania,4.29/5,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. Bottled on 02.28.22, so this is almost 11 months (10 months and 20 days) old.

Look: A fairly aggressive pour yields a nice one-finger of light-brown colored head with mostly small bubbles. The head gradually receded to hold around a quarter of a finger tall. The beer is very dark, almost black and appears to be somewhat viscous. Looks like a very nice bourbon-barrel aged imperial stout.

Smell: Strong, expressive aromas of bourbon and charred oak up front. It definitely smells boozy. Secondary notes of dark, alcohol-soaked cherries, coffee, rich dark chocolate, and vanilla. Halfway through, a nice note of a bit of sweet amaretto comes through also.

Taste: Really flavorful and luxuriously smooth. Something else that I am initially impressed with is the relatively high level of carbonation for a barrel-aged beer, which really helps prevent this beer from becoming overly sweet or thick on the palate. The finish lingers long; eventually I get charcoal notes well after my last sip. Bourbon spirit notes are very strong and a bit overpowering in my opinion. The decadent coffee and chocolate notes that were so present in Founders Breakfast Stout get lost in the crowd here.

Feel: Has a velvety smooth texture with a medium to full body. Carbonation is relatively high for a barrel-aged imperial stout and it works well here.

Overall: I have had KBS before but this is my first KBS review and my first tasting of the 2022 version. My overall impression of this is that it is very good. However I feel that it falls short compared to the base version of Founders Breakfast Stout, which I only had for the first time last month and I found it to be really delicious and impressive. This is still really good, yet I find the bourbon notes to be so strong, almost overpowering. Even though this was bottled almost 11 months ago, the bourbon notes are still super strong. I suppose if you really like bourbon, then this would be right up your alley. Personally, while I really do enjoy bourbon-barrel aged beers I do find that bourbon can be a bit harsh for my taste so I prefer Founders' base beer in this case. I will say that this this beer benefits greatly from coming to room temperature. I took it out of the fridge and waited several hours before I opened it, but it was probably still too cold initially.

From the bottle:
The beer that taught us that patience truly is a virtue. This big, bold imperial stout is brewed with premium chocolate and coffee then aged in bourbon barrels that introduce powerful notes of vanilla, cocoa, and charred oak. KBS is a luxuriant, full-bodied drinking experience that emanates sophistication while honoring our craft beer roots.","Jan 18, 2023"
KBS,,Australia,4.66/5,"Received from @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in January 2023.

L: Jet black, with a thin rim of tan head. Carbonation is visible if you look hard. 

S: Huge hit of roasted coffee and chocolate. A savoury/soy/umami note, as well as booze and barrel, come out as it warms. 

T: Big chocolate and coffee notes as per the nose. Vanilla and barrel come out as it warms. Retronasal booze is noticeable but pleasant. Residual stickiness after the swallow. Very dangerous for a 12% beer. Delicious. 

M: Mouthfeel is smooth, silky and sticky, faultlessly matching the rest of the beer. 

O: This is the only beer I've given a 5 on Untappd. I'm probably a harsh marker, but I'll give it a 4.75 when I check this one in. The main reason is that in hindsight I've had beers just as good as this one and only given them a 4.75. so in that case, what's a 5? Dunno. The theory is I'll know it when I encounter it. But back to this beer. God damn, it's delicious!

Now I must say, this is quite quite good. Like very good. Somewhere between a good stout and an aged whiskey, which isn't a surprise based on the drink itself. That being said, it does not exemplify the thing I like most about beer so far being, drinkability. I do like the refreshing nature of a beer quite a bit and that is the only thing I'd say is absent here. 

At 14.3 percent, it's quite high for a beer, and you feel a lingering alcohol taste towards the end. It is accompanied by some sweet notes like date and chocolate though. 

Mouthfeel is very unique in that somehow the bubbles feel thick. Like the consistency is buttery and but the bubbles feel heavy for some reason bringing out a very odd and unique, but not off putting, almost soupy texture. Mouthfeel end notes are sticky and also a little velvety or caramel-like. 

Smell is a little sour and very malt forward, slightly fruity and even slightly-er herby. 

If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend. I've been sipping as I write this and am appreciating it more and more. One hell of a beer. If you do grab one, the only thing I can say is that it's not smashable, but should be enjoyed slowly.","Aug 28, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,Canada (BC),4.86/5,"Finally getting to try this. 2022 vintage, poured from bottle into a snifter.

Look: Black-brown-red, thick, oily. Very thin light brown head, no retention except a tiny ring. 

Smell: Oh wow. Damn, this is pulling no punches. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, malt, bourbon, dark bread, and the tiniest hints of vanilla beans, raisins, and bananas. Incredibly complex.

Taste: YUUUUUP. Heavyweight, but incredibly smooth at the same time. Lots of the chocolate, with the vanilla bean and caramel notes playing second and third fiddle. Heavy maltiness and bourbon character, but still incredibly smooth with very little burn for the ABV. Raisin note is slightly present in the back, as well as the faintest banana peeking through once the malt onslaught begins to fade.

Feel: Thick but only slightly oily on the palette, light but lingering carbonation. Sticks around a bit, but in a pleasant way and doesn't overstay its welcome. Very slightly syrupy. Really pleasant.

The smell is very reminiscent of whiskey due to the barrel aging. Slight alcohol tinge, but very fruity and sweet smelling. The smell is like raisins or figs. There is a slight fermentation flavor that reminds me of wine, likely due to the high ABV.

The flavor is very sweet and low in bitterness. The flavor is extremely malty, and fruity. The taste seems like a cross between a high malt beer, a wine, and a bourbon. Notes of figs, raisins, trailed by syruppy molasses and fermentation flavors.

Overall: Absolute dynamite for the style, this is one of the best out there and lives up to the hype.","Mar 23, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,North Carolina,4.63/5,"Given to me as the bottle itself from a friend of mine. Poured into a snifter.

L - Pitch black, with a one-finger tan head. Head goes away after a few minutes or so. Fantastic lacing.
S - French-roast coffee, with chicory. Heavy notes of bourbon, oak, and dark chocolate. Hint of black Cavendish pipe tobacco.
T - Follows nose. Rich burnt sugar. Halfway through the glass, this brew evolves into a something else! Notes of vanilla, cacao, french-roast coffee, and chewy caramel. Hinting at fig, cherry, and raisin. Finish is long-acquired; leaning sweet, with a velvety oaken tobacco.
F - Full-bodied, with little carbonation. Viscous, but not syrupy. Velvety. Dense. Strong. This one is a sipper for sure, and it'll warm you up!
O - Another fantastic brew from Goose Island. While I wouldn't say it's worth the price in the slightest, it is a must-try. Funny enough, the ABV isn't detectable; I didn't realize how strong it was until I peeked at the label halfway through the glass! A delightful & decadent end to a chilly evening. Highly recommend, but I probably won't get it again.","Mar 21, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,,4.79/5,"Review: 
Look: Black as night. Like motor oil or tar. No head.
Smell: coffee, whiskey
Taste: incredible. Dark chocolate, coffee, cherries.
Feel: impossibly smooth for 14%. Very thick and dense. Creamy syrup. Touch of alcohol burn at the end but does a great job concealing it.
Overall: this is a sipper. If you like big stouts and whiskey, you gotta try this beer. Not an every day or after work beer, more of a treat. 5/5","Mar 18, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,Virginia,4.47/5,"L: Pours a dark brown, almost oily and black, into a tulip glass. Forms a moderate mocha head that dissipates fairly quickly. When held up against the light, it is an extremely dark chocolate color.

S: Bourbon barrels, vanilla, oak, raisins, burnt sugar, coffee.

T: Wow. Bourbon and booze. Coffee and roasted malts. Chocolate fudge. Char and a hint of cherries towards the end. Surprisingly sweet in the finish. Incredible. 

F: Full bodied. Coating and delicious thick texture, like velvet. Low carbonation.

O: This is one of the better barrel-aged imperial stouts I've had. Hefty ABV and yet smooth and drinkable. Great flavor. Aromas are maybe the weakest link, but that's nitpicking.","Mar 17, 2023"

Bourbon County Brand Stout,,North Carolina,4.8/5,"2022 version. Opaque, but no head. Somewhat fizzy. Honestly I was expecting more on the appearance. Vanilla and bourbon aroma. Wow the bourbon is very noticeable. I love the smell of whiskey, so I love the way this beer smells. The flavor is out of this world. Hard to believe the beer that set the standard for the style is still the standard. Vanilla and bourbon flavored with hints of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, perfect. This is an excellent beer. A true workmanship and craftsmanship.","Jan 28, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,Wisconsin,4.84/5,"Glugs pitch black with a modest layer of foam. Aroma is bourbon (the danger level bourbon - I swear there were klaxons going off), chocolate and dark toffee. Taste is dark fruit, chocolate and bourbon and is oh so nice. From the first sip, this is a sit back with a silly grin on your face kind of beer. Your belly warms from the inside with the swallow and visions of bottles of beer dance in your head.

Smell of bourdon, raisins, chocolate

Medium-heavy mouthfeel, creamy
Medium-light carbonation
Taste of raisins, figs, chocolate, bourbon, alcohol taste is there but pretty tame for its ABV.
Overall a good beer. Seems like there might be a quality control issue based upon comments in the forum and as good as it was it wasn't great. Founders KBS seems better at a fraction of the price. My first BCBS and will probably try it again.","Jan 11, 2023"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,New York,4.68/5,"Incredibly rich beer; if aristocrats drank beer, I imagine this is what they would drink. Thick, chocolate followed by vanilla, has that boozy, soy-sauce thing but not too much. Whiskey and toffee. It's definitely an extravagant beer; I wouldn't want to drink it every day.

Bourbon County Brand Stout,,Pennsylvania,4.59/5,"2022 edition. From a 16.9oz bottle into a snifter.

Pours a fairly thick black with a tiny amount of tan head that fades into a ring on the edge of the glass. No lacing to speak of.

Smells very boozy-strong barrel presence. Also chocolate, coffee and vanilla.

Taste is mostly barrel/bourbon when cold. On warming, this beer really opens up-chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla and light roastiness. Very well-balanced taste.

Drinks so smooth. Thick and full-bodied. Warming from abv. Bourbon aftertaste.

Fabulous brew. Glad I got to share with my dad and sis. Reality is, this is nice for a treat but cost prohibitive-$14/bottle where as you can get KBS and variants for about half that.","Dec 25, 2022"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,,4.39/5,"I love this. 2022 is the first I’ve had the privilege to have. Very strong, bourbon like, and smooth. I do think Founders KBS is better, but is still have the Coffee, Biscotto, and Sir Issacs left to try. Looking forward to each!","Dec 23, 2022"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,Canada (ON),4.9/5,"Finally released the 2022 in my area.

Pours motor oil and is pitch black in the glass. Small head that leaves some lacing.

Smells of chocolate. A ton of chocolate like it's almost overwhelming. I have no idea how there aren't adjuncts in here. Chocolate gets amplified by huge bourbon sweetness. A small amount of barrel comes through. Zero ethanol.

Taste is like a rush of chocolate with mixed in bourbon and oak vanilla. Very pleasant. Lots and lots of umami in here but just barely below the soy sauce threshold which is great. The barrel isn't that present but it's there in the background and on the finish. Great taste.

Very little carbonation which makes this huge gravity beer shine so well. It's like chocolate milk thick with that coating quality you want from good whisky. Really enhances the flavour profile.

So this was $30 for me because the alcohol monopoly just charges that for some reason but honestly it's worth it at least once. The half litre bottles are great and the 2022 release is actually my favourite ever, which might be a hot take. I'm always blown away by how much chocolate comes through on these but the 2022 integrated that flavour better than ever. I think the carbonation was also really excellent this year.","Dec 16, 2022"
Bourbon County Brand Stout,,,4.72/5,"Look: Poured from a pint and 6 oz bottle - Jet black pour into a 8oz tulip glass. No head risen to the surface on this one. Looks a bit thin for a tough 14.3%.
Smell: First smell I got was the bourbon followed by the chocolate, coffee aroma. Definitely getting some toffee and slight vanilla in there as well as hints of dried fruit.. Very nice!
Taste: Tastes JUST like the description! Very rich, huge baking chocolate notes with some slight vanilla in there. Getting the chocolate taste first followed by toffee - then the vanilla. Man this is so good!!
Feel: Medium bodied to heavy but very little carbonation. Very smooth easy sipper.
Overall: I was hesitant paying the amount I did on this bottle but MAN I'm so glad I did. Many beer lovers said this was the beer that turned them into serious beer drinkers and I see why!!! Definitely gonna be buying this tomorrow to store it for a year to see where this can go. This is definitely top three barrel aged beers I've ever tasted and I'm looking forward to trying their coffee version as well!!","Dec 10, 2022"

Very HHHazyyy,,Washington,4.19/5,"16 oz can courtesy of Roguer. Per the stamp on the bottom of the can, this was canned on October 6, 2022. ""Happy Birthday, Uncle TJ!"" is also stamped there.

Poured into the snifter that was also courtesy of Roguer, this was an opaque, yellow-like color, with a good sized off-white head that was long lasting and left lots of lace.

Massive, bitter, citrusy nose to this.

Initially, quite bitter and astringent tasting, just a citric acid blast. As it warmed, balance crept in, with some sweet melon-like flavors offsetting the massive citrus fruit juice, along with something like a light touch of vanilla. Citrus flavor remained dominant, throughout, however. Finishes with a bitter dryness.

Lightly creamy and yet dry mouth feel.

Initially, I had low hopes for it, but as I sipped at it while watching a movie, it warmed up and the flavor profile changed to be rather pleasant. Thanks, Roguer!","Jan 14, 2023"

Very HHHazyyy,,Rhode Island,4.73/5,"Poured on 1/7/2023 from a 16oz can into a snifter glass.

A: The beer is a very hazy (of course) deep orange/gold color, with a large foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus & tropical fruit, strong floral & dank hops and caramelized malts.

T: The taste likewise starts out with a strong juicy and sweet tropical & citrus fruit flavor. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not to heavy and brings an extremely good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.

M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.

Very HHHazyyy,,Massachusetts,4.13/5,"Consumed 11/23/22

Yellow orange with some gold tones, very hazy (obviously), pours with a small head that fades quickly to a small collar, leaves some nice lacing
Fruit cocktail-like aroma, very potent, citrus, floral and perfume-like citrus, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, strong herbal notes, some dank notes, big peach, stone fruits, tropical fruits, some pineapple and melon, mango (including the ""cheesy"" character I get with actual mango), moderate bitterness, some fruity astringency, alcohol is fairly noticeable to me, finishes with lingering fruit
Medium body, smooth and chewy but with some resinous stickiness, lower than average carbonation

Very HHHazyyy is exxxtremeee(TM), excessive, and indulgent. As it should be. That being said, Haze is one of my favorite Tree House beers, and I prefer it to Very Hazy. And I prefer Very Hazy to this. It's certainly an experience, but I probably won't be drinking this regularly.","Nov 23, 2022"
Very HHHazyyy,,Massachusetts,4.73/5,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Sandwich, MA
10/06/22
Served in a Tree House Brewing Company teku

Outstanding appearance. The beer poured a nearly opaque, pale straw yellow hue and was topped by a frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that slowly dropped to a lasting film. A wall of streaky, drippy lacing blanketed the glass and stuck until the drink’s end.

The aroma was fantastically hoppy and bright. Peach and apricot notes came through big time. Loads of juicy citrus as well. Orange and orange peel notes were most apparent. Good dose of mango too. Honeydew melon was also detectable, along with the signature Tree House bubble gum-like yeast character. Some alcohol appeared as the beer sat.

The flavor profile was nearly as stellar as the nose. Juicy citrus notes dominated on the front end. Like in the aroma, orange and orange peel were noticeable. Peach and apricot appeared as the beer moved along the palate. Some honeydew melon too. Pithy orange rind notes came through again on the back end and in the finish. Moderate amount of lingering bitterness.

The mouthfeel was super soft and supple. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a finely beaded, ultra mellow effervescence that worked nicely.

Very HHHazyyy is an other terrific double IPA in the Tree House catalog, though perhaps not too different from many of their other top-rated hoppy beers. I would gladly drink this again, but I probably would not actively seek it out.","Oct 22, 2022"
Very HHHazyyy,,Massachusetts,3.55/5,"Pours a dirty blonde, kinda murky. White head, Peach and tangerine on the nose. Some muted flavors - peach, unripe mango, banana. It is pulpy. It is just a bit underwhelming. I would much rather have Haze than this. Not worth the hhhypeee.","Oct 16, 2022"
Very HHHazyyy,,North Carolina,4.37/5,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy goldenstray with three fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves clumps of lacing

Smell: Dank aromatics, with orange, mango, pineapple, passionfruit and melon tones

Taste: Hints of melon and toffee underneath with the more assertive fruits garnering most of the attention; very dank, with orange pith joined by mango and pineapple and passionfruit; considerable but not overwhelming bitterness, after the swallow with an herbal peppery finish

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation

Overall: After being a bit underwhelmed by Very Hazy, this one shows a bit more from Tree House; its a bit angular but I can see why it gets the hype

Flora Plum,,New York,4.52/5,Solid beer - a bit plum tart aftertaste.,"Jul 07, 2023"
Flora Plum,,New York,4.76/5,"Original bottling

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".

Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.

All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.

Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment","Dec 12, 2021"

Flora Plum,,Maine,4.62/5,"Alan, I cannot thank you enough for this bottle. 

375ml bottle - 2018 vintage - poured into a wide tulip at 44°F. 

Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible. 

Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular. 

Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity. 

Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine. 

Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead.","Oct 04, 2020"
Flora Plum,,Ohio,4.84/5,"Displaying a unique color of lightly foggy pale orange or even crayon peach, a moderately dense white blanket settles down to a curled, quietly active ring.

The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing.

Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow.

Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar.","Apr 21, 2020"

By way of background I’ve never had a fruited beer from Hill Farmstead beer, and I’ve never had the base beer, Florence. 

Look: The first thing I notice is the beautiful color of this beer. It’s pours a translucent and slightly hazy appearance. The color matches what is describe as the pale, pinkish orange color on the inside of a plum. If I had to name the color in would say “pink champagne.” Bone white head that settles to a thin layer across the top, a thing ring of bubbles around the edge. One of the prettiest, and most uniquely colored beers I have ever seen. 

Smell: Fruity, acidic, funky, all in unison. Peach and plum fruitiness with lemon and white vinegar acidity. The funk comes through as body odor and hint of plastic. Sweet, floral aromas. A touch powdery. Some light berry notes including strawberry and raspberry. There is a dry, crackery, wheat-like component to the beer. The most complex aspect of this beer. 

Taste: On the tip of the tongue some lemon zest and juicy plum sweetness. Then the tart acidity takes over. Tart, unripe plum, plum skin, lemon warhead. The beers dried out quickly. There is not really any funk coming through on the flavor profile. I assume the wine barrels used for this beer held white wine as opposed to red wine. 

Feel: Low carbonation and very light on the palate. Very dry with tart acidity hitting the jowels. 

Overall: A delicate and highly drinkable beer. It’s not the most intense or complex saison that I’ve had, but it’s right up my alley with the fruit and acidity. It’s a beautiful expression of plum. It has some funk on the nose, but the flavor profile relies exclusively on the fruit and acidity. Really excellent. Clean and crisp.","Jun 16, 2019"

Flora Plum,,Virginia,4.44/5,"2018 release.

A: Pours a very light pale, hazy, kind of berliner-like, with a cap of bright white head which quickly fizzles out to a sharp ring. Nicely effervescent. Minimal retention and no lacing.

S: Moderate sour plum and grainy wheat, hefty amount of barnyard funk and a hint of spice.

T: Rich juicy plum and wheat, light earthy funk, finishing with a crisp medium-light tartness on a fairly lengthy finish. 

M: Medium-high, somewhat sharp carbonation. Light bodied.

O: Tasty, refreshing, drinkable, and exceptionally well balanced. The sourness is restrained and the fruit is delicious.","Nov 18, 2018"
Flora Plum,,Massachusetts,3.97/5,"03/2016 - I want to like this more but the nose is just unpleasant to me - it smells like plastic, basically. Thankfully, the palate is chock full of plum, nice oakiness, juicy fruit, with a touch of tartness in back; the finish is creamy, tart, and has a solid acidity.","Sep 26, 2018"
Flora Plum,,New York,4.54/5,Had this on draft at Hill Farmstead - sourgasm!!,"Sep 13, 2018"
Flora Plum,,Rhode Island,4.74/5,"Poured from a 375mL bottle into a HF bulb. Batch 2. Thanks Ryan for sharing this. 

Pours a pinkish-purple hazy body with a one finger frothy head. Doesn't leave much lacing or retention.

Aromas are out of this world, nearly a 5 in this category - straight fresh plums and stone fruit, candied plum, tart lactic, light funk. 

On the tongue, the plums don't pop as much but they're definitely present. Typical Hill Farmstead funk, citrus, but not too acidic. Subtly tart and very balanced, this might be least sour Flora variant I've had. Mouthfeel is nice and easy drinking, light and refreshing. 

Overall an outstanding beer, and my favorite of the fruited floras.","Aug 23, 2018"
Flora Plum,,Massachusetts,4.71/5,"375 ml bottle poured into a teku at a share. 

Pours slightly golden with a pinkish hue. Minimal head that dissipates quick. No lacing down the side. Champagne like bubbles. 

Aroma is funk, tartness and sweet plums. Smells absolutely fantastic. 

Taste is amazing. Super balanced. Fruity and funky but not overpowering in the funk area. Subtle tartness to balance out the plum. Simply delicious.

Feel is thin and light as expected for this style. Bubbly with lots of carb. 

Overall, this is an amazing Flora variant. Maybe my favorite. The addition of plums makes this super delicious.","Aug 15, 2018"
Flora Plum,,California,5/5,"This is probably the best Hill Farmstead beer ive had. It takes Floras great base beer and blends perfectly with the plums to create a something amazing. Id drink one of these a day if i could, it was that good.","Jul 17, 2018"
Flora Plum,,Illinois,4.58/5,"poured from a 375mL bottle into a perennial wine glass. pours the color of ruby red grapefruit juice with some soapy white head which dies down to form a white collar around the glass. smells of fresh plums, lemons and grapefruit plus oak and a tinge of white wine. it has a much livelier acidic nose than most HF. taste is citrus and plum with lemon and oak. not really sour at all. refreshing and super easy and enjoyable to drink. mouthfeel is full with a nice amount of carbonation. not overly so but enough to give it a lively spritziness. overall, the best fruited flora i’ve had and one of my favorite HF saisons.","Jul 16, 2018"
Flora Plum,,Massachusetts,5/5,"I had the great fortune of sharing a bottle of Flora Plum with a close friend when visiting Cape Cod in the summer of 2018. Quite possibly the best sour I've had.

Flora Plum,,Canada (ON),4.63/5,"Batch 1: Bright gold pour, light haze, smaller head that fizzles out fast. amazing balance in the aroma and taste here. Slightly under-ripe yellow plum, rustic notes, wheat, barnyard funk, lemon notes, lighter oak notes, light vanilla sweetness, light yogurt lactic sourness. Nothing here exhausts the palate - no one component completely takes over this beer. Lighter body, carbonation is spot on.","Jun 23, 2018"
Flora Plum,,Massachusetts,4.25/5,"Received in a trade, shared with JLindros.

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice clear light honey golden hue with a thin head that fades to leave light wisps.

S - Aromas of typical funky flora type saison. Light wine notes, fair amount of mineral notes, not much plum.

T - Taste is similar to the nose, good wine notes with pleasant saison yeast. Little bit of barrel, the wine is really pleasant however there is very little plum.

M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp, clean.

O - Overall this was a very solid farmhouse, however, the plum notes were too subtle for my tastes.

Definitely think it borders on living up to the hype - a very good hazy. Super soft and creamy; little grassier than I prefer my IPAs, but this is balanced enough that it's not a detraction nor is it over the top. Glad I finally got the tick on this one, but there are definitely other Trillium hazies I would prefer to this.",Tuesday at 08:31 AM

Headroom,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Pours a very hazy fleshy peach color with a fluffy off white head that leaves ringlets of lace as you enjoy the beer. Gorgeous hazy.

The nose is dank and packed with sweet peach aromas, orange peel, some grapefruit, and lots of mango and pineapple. This is literally a beer fruit basket of aromas.

The peach flavors lead the taste and are delicious, with the orange, mango, and pineapple flavors following, with a bit of green grapes mid palate and a nice creamy oat flavor on the finish. Very balanced and oh so delicious.

The mouthfeel is full, soft, and creamy, adding to the drinkability. This is a magnificent representation of the style, IMHO.","Sep 10, 2023"
Headroom,,District of Columbia,4.24/5,"On tap:
Cloudy bruised peach with a typical hazy head that clings to the edges pretty well. Nose is melon and unripe tropical fruits midway through without any agitation. Giving the beer a swirl ripens the fruits pretty quickly, giving a sweeter impression overall (some sniffs expose an overripe burn, but it’s not the norm).

When cold, the beer opens with an almost tart fruit note, which contrasts poorly with the more bitter middle and finish. It doesn’t completely disappear as the beer warms, but it does mellow out and blend in better. The sweetness notes in the nose after a swirl pervades the opening through to near the finish, reducing the contrast, but taking the bitterness I enjoyed in the back end of a colder beer.

This beer went from a disjointed start with highs and lows to a more balanced, but also more typical, very good hazy.","Sep 08, 2023"
Headroom,,Virginia,4.53/5,"On tap, pours a beautiful hazy glowing orange. Smell is an immediate assault of fresh grapefruit, followed by layers of berry and a touch of dank. Taste follows. Feel is smooth and dang near perfect. No booze, no burn. Outstanding.","Sep 07, 2023"

This is it, the pinnacle of Trillium, finally seeing the light of day again. I never got a chance to try it before, so I’m glad they finally rebrewed it. I literally just picked this up after work which was my first trip to Trillium in quite a while. Let’s crack it open and see if it lives up to the hype

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is super soft in the nose, with a defined hop bite but not a hop burn they've unfortunately come to be known for. I'm picking up on aromas of overripe mango, papaya, doughy malt, earthy hops, peach rings, pineapple juice, grass, light weed, and red grapefruit

In taste it's quite similar, but still right on the verge of that hop burn character which is holding it back a bit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange zest, papaya, peach rings, white grape, bready malt, weedy hops, pineapple juice, and light grapefruit. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, papaya, pithy grapefruit, earthy hops, peach rings, overripe mango, light white grape, and grass

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes neutral with just a touch of hop burn

This is pretty damn good, but I still don't think it's worthy of its hype. Maybe a few more days will help clear up some of the greener notes","Sep 01, 2023"
Headroom,,Kentucky,5/5,"This was hands down my favorite Trill brew. I might even dare to say that its my favorite double IPA I've ever had. Its that good..

Headroom,,Florida,3.77/5,On tap at the tasting room. Cloudy/milky orangish/yellow pour with a white head. More tangy than I’m accustomed too from Trillium.

Headroom,,New York,4.67/5,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This is a really good-looking NEIPA - juicy, milkshake-like burnt yellow with a near-1-finger white head on top. 

S: Nose does NOT disappoint - it jumps out of the glass with a bushel of fruit: pineapple, melon, ripe apricot/peach, a touch of lime. 

T: Pretty much follows the nose, with pineapple, ripe melon, mango, tangerine, orange creamsicle, then finishing with a lemon-lime bitterness and key lime pie. The 8% ABV is not noted at all, though I think I'm getting a little warmth in the belly. 

M: Medium to full-bodied, creamy feel to this one - more creamy than juicy, if that makes sense. Real nice feel to it, challenges Tree House's best in that regard.

O: Phenomenal. A really, really good NEIPA.","Aug 17, 2020"
Headroom,,California,4.59/5,"Succulent banana milk haze in the glass, with a solid finger of rocky white foam. Smells like a New York City fruit cart on a hot summer day. The kind of juicy, drippy ripe fruit that you can smell from a block and a half away. Taste follows with sun-warmed pineapple, lychee, and whipped cream. Mouthfeel is soft & creamy, and fully coating. Finishes with a hit of resinous pine, and orange rind. Remarkable effort in a month of truly remarkable Trillium beers.","Aug 08, 2020"

It's still a big beer, but it delivers on flavor.","Sep 22, 2019"
Headroom,,Alabama,4.4/5,"Canned 08/01/19, 10:11:09.

Lightly pale golden yellow.. opaque in appearance and without much of any rising and/or settling head above the beer. Small dots of lace cling to the glass.

The nose is more hop-forward than you’d think; scallions and grassy hops, with undertones of underripe papaya and bright citrus. 

Great balance of hops and fruit on the palate. Pineapple-heavy, with undertones of mildly bitter tangerine and dank, grassy hops. As it opens up a little more, lime really stands out and compliments the hops.

Lighter mouthfeel than I expected. Fairly sharp carbonation, with a smooth finish that leaves a noticeable stickiness behind. Very mild booziness, a smooth 8%.","Sep 05, 2019"
Headroom,,Virginia,4.5/5,"On tap at The Veil Summer Fest.

Nice orange golden hazy look with some lacing. Lots of citrus and papaya type notes in the nose, a bit zesty as well. Taste follows nose with lots of citrus flavor and a good dose of earthiness. Moderate mouthfeel due to the flaked wheat, light carbonation, construction and balance the excellence you expect from Trillium.","Sep 02, 2019"
Headroom,,California,3.88/5,"Pours thick and milky and golden, just what you'd expect from a well-loved Trillium beer. Smell is grass, green onion, and maaaaaybe a liiiittle citrus? But not enough for my liking. Taste is equally bitterness-forward, and doesn't match the flavors my eyes were expecting. It's nice to be reminded NEIPAs aren't all pure juice, but it also reaffirms what I like in a beer.

Atrial Rubicite,,New Jersey,4.38/5,"A: Bacterial degradation on the collar, which quickly inches in stature until the hasty retreat. Despite that, a constant longevity to the brim, providing a categorical aptness. In the interim, a trivial exposure on the collars cling, which substantially decreases through the periods. The appearance off the decant comes to a sangria to pansy purple dye, while highlighting pompadour to the carafe, as the vessel (on transfer) missions a bole tinge. On-top, an alabaster cap that brims to a link white per the aforementioned. The coloration presets get stretched on the discharge, as a way to represent a semi-transparent elegance

S: An earthy introduction with a relaxed awareness on esters, as the microbial contagions adhere to the vintage. Confident components to the aged-oppressed raspberries through a matured involvedness, from a ripened oldness to an oxidative mephitis. Howbeit, a calculated fetor that’s initially repressed, as the draw comes with an hourly aridness. With this mind, the presetting notations reap the aggregates, of an array on drupelets ascribing raspberries. The symbolism stretches to a Clafoutis complexion, while remaining seedy and rooted to the additive. All the while, an implication to ethyl hexanoate, where the apple correspondences meld softly to the phenolic spin-offs. Such bonuses speak to the loitering spices found in eugenol, while complimenting the framework over the adjacent ketone (C10H12O2). At no cost, a wet – woodsy – hop effect that lends a resin kindness to the leafy tannins, aside the peppered herbaceous rearguards. The bacterial agents on lactobacillus are present to the caducity, while evolving a Camembert refinedness thru the employed (bottle) conditioning. Sequentially, a more captivating element on the native drivers, which offer a nuanced mustiness to cattle sheds, amid a smirched growth on Stinkhorns

T: The virulence is perceptible on the cellared acidity, which comes with a well-bred dryness, for yeast explicitness. Nonetheless, a raspberry opulence to not be overtaken, yet an accessory that now parallels the implied draws on clingstone peaches & citron lemons. Markedly, an isoamyl octanoate nexus to the structure, which is supportive to the grains on rusticity. Assuaging hops provide a herbal kick to the eugenol compounds that touch on clove, when pitching resin to the concourse. The age welcomes a pastoral fondness with a vanilla oak consideration to the tannins on berries, as an acetate solvency crawls behind. A movement that expresses abandoned bunker silos, while airing farmland mildew on rabbity phenols. Moreover, an Alpaca wool note that corresponds to damp cattlehide, as a decanted nuttiness formulates aside moldy caverns. Oxidation comes sequentially with an elevated solvency on epoxy, while setting up Sangiovese commonalities. Correspondingly, a move in time that’s deftly degassed, as dry leather nears tobacco, when bordering burnt guaiacols

M: An alleviated sweetness that’s pitted against acidic motorists, which is aeriated intentionally to strategically stabilize. There is a minerality factor that resembles an autumn jog with a soft mist, while tannins support an attenuated dry rider. In this situation, the approach inaugurates a bright vivacity that doesn’t pierce, but rather respects the framework, as a soft texture grows upon the weathered advancements

O: The vintage has an acerbic presence that’s regulated thru wild yeast auras. Phenols that assist esters in an involved growth, while malts gently circulate a toasted granularity. Chiefly, one with an operative uniqueness to the raspberry add-ons, as a bacterial exsiccation maps out","Dec 21, 2022"

Atrial Rubicite,,Connecticut,4.4/5,"2020 vintage (Blend 10/April 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022

Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.

Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.

Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close.

Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.","Jul 31, 2022"

Atrial Rubicite,,Maine,4.59/5,"Blend 9 (April, 2019) - 500ml bottle - poured into a wine stem at 45°F.

Pours a translucent deep blood red, with garnet highlights, sitting like pinot noir in the glass, a think collar of pink foam circumnavigates the ruby elixir. Just stunning.

Nose: Incredibly intense raspberry aroma. There's a jammy element like raspberry preserves, atop a true wild raspberry bush aroma, with ripe raspberries, unripe raspberries, raspberry seeds, stems, and leaves, macerated raspberries, overripe raspberries...Raspberry squared. There's also a massive vinous note - like a bold red wine, perhaps a grenache, with berry compote, blackberry, strawberry, blueberry, red grape, and a big oaky note. There's a hefty funk presence, with old wet wood, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, rackhouse, dried leaves, hay, and even some horseblanket. A slight grassy note as well. It's complex, concentrated, saturated, and absolutely incredible.

Palate: Like the aroma, this beer greets you with a facefull of raspberry. Not sourness. Not funk. Ripe red raspberry. Super organic, like an actual raspberry. Jammy, sweet, tart, seedy...liquid raspberry. You get my drift here? You take a raspberry...and drink it. A wild, but balanced acidity follows, bringing some lemon- like tartness, and just a whisper of balsamic vinegar. There's plenty of farmhouse funk, with wet hay, wet wood, and a dusty, musty, earthen note that just screams ""Texas"". The oak note is similar to bourbon, with some leather, caramel, and vanilla undertones, and then some grain peeks through underneath. The tartness overtakes the sweetness, introducing some lactic minerality, quickly drying the beer out, and finishing dry, with raspberry essence, tingly tarness, and oak.

Mouthfeel/Body: Atrial is a light-bodied ale, but the raspberry sweetness does add just a touch of weight, giving some smooth dimension to it all. Acidity is bright, sour, but restrained - far from heartburn territory. Effervescence is moderate, and super fine to a champagne degree. Sweet and wet to start, finishing nearly bone dry, and quite clean.

Overall: This is a special beer. There's a reason it is so respected, and I fully understand it. There are other amazing raspberry sours out there, and I've had several of them, but Atrial Rubicite is in a league of its own, and is without a doubt, a world class wild ale, and one deserving of praise. If you're reading this and wondering, stop wondering. Get the bottle.","Oct 20, 2020"
Atrial Rubicite,,New York,4.74/5,"Poured from a bottle (blend 10, bottled Apr2020) into a Belgian glass

L: very rich, dark ruby red with a matching (slightly lighter color) head that fades after a minute or two. Some decent bubbles around the edge

S: amazing, deep raspberry nose. Like freshly puréed for a smoothie, embarrassingly reminds me of Häagen-Dazs raspberry sorbet. Little bit of funk, nice and tart, smells awesome

T: follows the nose with great freshly picked raspberry flavor. Lightly tart, a little pithy, beautiful fresh fruit. Medium/long finish, nicely drying. Great flavor, more restrained than the nose if that makes sense

F: medium/light body, medium carbonation, perfectly drying

More so than any Belgian lambics that I’ve had (not that I’ve had all that many.) it’s tart but not overwhelmingly so. More so than someone who doesn’t know sours or lambics would normally like though.

This smells a little bit like red wine, vanilla, and oak - but it's mostly jammy, seedy, and fairly intense raspberry on the nose.

This does a good job reminding you what the fruit here actually is - it's raspberry, duh - but there's more to it. There's some oak and slight vanilla sweetness, along with a really pleasant soft and inviting acidity. There's a pleasant smudge of wine barrel here.

L -- Golden orange with the usual HF fluffy, sticky, white head 
S -- What a lovely showcase of Galaxy. Not too sweaty/oniony, just tons of tropical fruit, creamy citrus flesh, and sweet floral. Doesn't pop out of the glass like Trillium's galaxy-forward offerings
T -- While the pineapple and orange sherbert notes of Galaxy are definitely there, there's also a decent amount of this interesting nelson-like white grape character, and also a hint of mosaic-lile cattiness. Oat forward malt bill makes for a neutral sweetness

Medium thick, frothy white head, that quickly thins out. Vivid, cloudy, medium orange color, with much intricate lacing to start off with. The aroma has a candied malt, guava, pineapple, a little mixed sweet spice underneath. Flavors of candied tangerine peel, guava, passion fruit, with a bit of help from some medium toast malt, in the background, to fill out the body and some of the flavors.

Consumed 10/18/20

As with all the best NEDIPAs, this is a beautiful beer. If it didn't taste and smell so amazing, I'd wonder if they made beers just to look pretty on Instagram, but this matches on the other notes. I love that the ones from the Northeast do have a bit more of a bitter dry finish than the Midwestern ones that I drink most often (being from Chicago.) I DO wish they'd change to a 16oz can. There's a reason why that's so popular now as a format size, and with the dryer finish, I could really drink more than 12oz in a sitting. There's not as much on the nose as the super fresh Hop Butcher's that I most often drink, but that might be due to the can being a month old. I still get nice hops and bitter grapefruit rind on the nose and pallet. It's a wonderfully balanced beer. Will HF ever expand and increase distribution? If so, people will undoubtedly say their quality has dropped even if it doesn't. I'd love to see this in my area. Don't ever pass this one up!","Oct 18, 2020"
Double Galaxy,,Vermont,4.49/5,"L: Hazy yellow with a thick, creamy head and good lacing.

S: Bright, pungent tropical fruit, grapefruit, a small amount of dank, pine, and a touch of spicy booze. Some subtle pale malt in the background as well.

T: Firm but mild bitterness upfront, moves into a huge wave of citrusy tropical fruit flavors. A piney resinous edge to the flavor as well as some peach notes. The malt flavor is surprisingly full and provides a good base as well as a bit of sweetness to support the hop flavors.

F: Full bodied but still a drying finish.

Overall: A full on juicy hop experience with surprising complexity for a single-hop beer. Everything works perfectly to create a supremely balanced and drinkable ale.","Sep 16, 2020"

Double Galaxy,,New Hampshire,4.52/5,"From a 12oz can, dated 06/23/20. Served in a willi becher.

Pours an opaque mucky orange with two-plus fingers of lush, lathery, cream colored foam. Retention is excellent slowly settling into a big lumpy cap with a tattered curtain of thick lacing.

The nose is sharp and clean, pungent, fruity yeast. Pineapple and hard candies. 

Taste is juicy-sticky-fruity but with surprisingly assertive bitterness. Pineapple and mango, a sour peach skins-sort-of-grassy taste, yeasted bread roll and mineral water. The sour peach skin/grassy thing persists into the aftertaste.

Feel is smooth and juicy, starts sticky but finishes clean, medium bodied with perfect carbonation. There is a mild, understated boozy warmth going down which is wholly appropriate to the style.

Overall, probably pretty close to the perfect NEDIPA. The mildly sour, grassy, underripe peach skin aftertaste is the only (very) minor complaint I have and was easily corrected for by taking the next sip.","Jul 02, 2020"

L: brown orange color, more dirty than creamy. Great white head with solid lacing. As I drink it lacing really is standout

S: soft, tropical, dank fruit I'd expect from galaxy. Passionfruit, mango, orange, grapefruit. Maybe some slight piney notes. Even, beautiful nose that's getting me excited for a sip!

T: nose follows through but a bit more subdued, led by sharper citrus notes (orange/grapefruit) with a decent hop bite. Some piney flavor, steers clear of the vegetal/grassy issues I've had with some galaxy (that may be more galaxy batch than beer, but still). Nice hint of abv warmth as I drink it, but there's no boozy notes of note (sorry...)

F: quite soft without being creamy or overly pillowy. Medium carbonation. Hard to not just down this frankly

Can stamped 02/24/20
Straw colored, turbid, with a pillowy white head that pushes damn near 3 fingers in height. Slowly recedes to a consistent, persistent finger high for the next 3-4 minutes. Some sticky lacing.
Aroma bursts with an initial onslaught of zesty citrus: grapefruit, orange, lemon zest. But there's a honey-tinged grainy note too, akin to wet oats and buckwheat. I could smell this all day.
Taste, again citrus forward but, more complex.m There's subtle hints of peach, cantaloupe, lemongrass, understated nods to onion and herbal spice that quickly retreat and leave a melange of crackery malt and a lingering grass-tinged bitterness.
Mouthfeel is , well Hill Farmstead. I truly feel like the water is a key characteristic, their terroir. This one is a bit fluffy, and there is a mineral note that is divine. Carbonation is there throughout, but not prominent.
Overall, the best example of a GALAXY focused DIPA or IPA I've ever tasted. One suggestion that would make this better, delivery to California.","Mar 31, 2020"

Double Galaxy,,Connecticut,4.49/5,"Smells most prominently of ripe (not overripe/mushy) cantaloupe with secondary notes of citrus and a kiss of grassiness.

Taste mostly follows the nose: big cantaloupe up front followed by a light oniony bite. A swells of hoppy sweetness then fades into a clean grassy bitterness. A light citrus undertone carries through the palette and finish. A delicate crackery malt presence carries through and lingers long after the sip.

Mouthfeel is on point. This beer is hazy, it is not turbid and it certainly doesn't feel chewy like many recent NEDIPAs. The body is as full as it needs to be to support the hop character and alcohol, but it never detracts from the beers other features.

Double Galaxy,,Nevada,4.23/5,"Picked up a 6 pack of this at the source in late October. What a fun day that was. 

Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/3"" white head. Good retention for style. Has the nice Galaxy smell, pineapple definitely the most prominent tropical fruit note.

Taste is easy like Sunday morning, below average bitterness, below average hop burn/acidity. Above average tropical fruit notes, still lead by the pineapple quotient. Malt bill is minimal and non descript outside of the normal parameters of pale malt, 2 row and flaked oats. Relatively soft mouth feel because of all that. 8% drinks pretty easy here. The difference in a decade between imperial ipas to now, so much different, less bitterness and alcohol burn to say the least. 

Holy moly, look at that average score! While I think this is a very good beer, damn, there are literally more than a hundred double/imperial ipas that are just as good in California alone. Happy I got to try it, but if you haven't, don't feel like its some grail that has to happen, don't fomo this, you have something like it around you.

M: It feels medium-bodied, a little crisp, and somewhat juicy on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,,New York,4.53/5,"On tap at Trillium, my 2nd ever beer from them.

Pours a hazy orange color, with a moderate and well retaining frothy head. Pretty much the same look as the DDH Sleeper Street I had earlier.

The aroma displays juicy notes of tropical fruit, particularly, passion fruit, guava and mango. These are accompanied by citrus notes of grapefruit, orange and lemon. Herbal aromas evoke grass and mint. 

Medium to full bodied with a mouthfeel that opens relatively smoothly, while the carbonation is moderate and on par for the style. Tropical notes of passion fruit, guava, and mango lend a softness and a juicy sweetness, less intense than the DDH Sleeper Street I had earlier. Also, the firm malt and wheat backbone contributed to the soft and doughy sweetness. However, as the citrusy flavors of grapefruit rind, orange pith, lemon and lime open up, their zesty nature adds balancing spice. Furthermore, the developing herbal hops flavors of pine and grass add both bitterness and a prickliness to the mouthfeel. The finish is long, dry and with a resiny hops burn that lingers in the palate.

Tough to rate against the DDH Sleeper Street, nevertheless, I can say with confidence that both are world class and deserving of comparable scores.","Jan 27, 2020"

Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,,Connecticut,4.74/5,"L - not sure how this one has eluded me for so long. Pours a thick murk. I'd say yellow, but it's a dark shade of yellow, almost brown. Oily head with a rainbow sheen.

S - fruity peach, pineapple, and apricot. Herbal mango and hop esters. Tart lemon balances an incredible aroma.

T - soft candied orange and tangerine. Subtly spicy with dank hop oils and vibrant passionfruit. Citrus rind a la grapefruit, orange, and lemon-lime, but almost no bitterness, just a mild tingle. Still manages to avoid total sweetness with a touch of dryness and overall herbal undertones. Gentle and balanced.

F - mostly soft and fluffy with a hint of electric zest from the hop acidity. Full without being overly viscous. Low carbonation.

O - one of Trillium's best. Not the juiciest or the most potent, but one of the most balanced. Soft, pithy flavors and focus on extracting as much flavor from the dry hopping as possible. Herbal without feeling like you're biting into raw hops and juicy without feeling like you're drinking Juicy Juice.","Sep 11, 2019"
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,,Michigan,4.53/5,"Mother of god this one was tasty. At first I thought I had a ""regular"" Trillium Congress Street, then realized I'd somehow scored the DDH version (found it online). Canned date 8/9/19 so I made sure to try this one fresh. And it knocked my socks off! Loved the look - reminded me of some of the best Tree House offerings. Very hazy yellow color with lots of fluffy white head and thick sheets and rings of lingering lacing that clung to the glass and did not fade away. Aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, papaya, tangerine, passionfruit and guava; also malt, caramel, creamy vanilla and some weaker floral hops. Some dankness in the background. Taste follows the nose, great balance between the slightly bitter hops and sweeter malt backbone. Extremely juicy. At first I was going to give the smell/taste ratings of 4/4.25 since they were surprisingly muted and I was disappointed. But then as the beer warmed a little the second glass was incredible, more pungent and flavorful and complex with more depth. This is what I was looking for! Mouthfeel was incredible, soft, pillowy, luscious, sticky, smooth, coated the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation. Just an outstanding beer and I am lucky to have acquired other Trillium beers to try.","Sep 01, 2019"
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,,Tennessee,4.46/5,"Pours a hazy murky pale orange or orange with some yellow thrown in to tone it down some. Two finger off white head falls slow and laces well.

Aroma is light tropical fruits with more citrus bite then the others from Trillium at least it seems so at this time. Besides the citrus and tropical fruits some pine resin mingled in there some where. This one actually smells like it might have some bitterness to it.

Taste is pretty much starts fruity NEIPA style typical pineapple, mango, passion fruits but moves to more regular citrus grapefruit rind bitterness. Finish is what makes this one a little different god the grapefruit rind along with some pine like resin mingled in to add to the bitterness, like the best of both worlds.

Mouthfeel is medium nice bready malt base to hold all the hops. Carbonation is little past medium to add a little zing to the beer.

Overall say this is the best out of the four 4 packs I picked up at the brewery. Hopefully my ratings will reflect that but who knows what I will like on what day, lol.","Aug 11, 2019"

Pretty dang hazy too, exactly what you'd expect in a NEIPA.","Aug 07, 2023"
Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,,Massachusetts,4.34/5,"Canned 4/6/23

I had the OG Ghost In The Machine early last year, and while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I found the hop burn to be a bit of a problem with it. A DDH version sounds like it could make things even worse on that front, but this is a highly regarded beer so I had to order it when I saw it on Tavour. Let’s crack it open and see what it’s all about

Pours a hazy milky yellow with 2 fingers of soapy off white head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose is aggressive here, but it’s aggressive in a great way that does not suggest hop burn. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, orange juice, bready malt, grassy hops, dank weed, white pepper, and a touch of caramel

And unfortunately this one also gets a bit too aggressive in taste, but I’m still enjoying it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy hops, orange juice, dank weed, overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, white pepper, and light pine. The swallow brings notes of earthy hops, dank weed, orange juice, overripe cantaloupe, pithy grapefruit, bready malt, pine, pineapple juice, and an odd hint of gasoline

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and bitter because of the hops burn, but it eventually settles out

I really wanted this one to be better than the original, but it’s really about the same. A bit less hop burn leads to a greater drinkability, but the odd gasoline note prevents me from bumping up the taste score","May 22, 2023"

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,,New York,5/5,"DDH Ghost in the Machine pours a hazy, golden color with a fluffy white head that leaves behind a beautiful lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is incredibly inviting, with prominent notes of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine. The double dry-hopping process really shines through in the aroma, with a depth and complexity that is unmatched.

On the palate, the beer is just as impressive. The first sip is bursting with juicy hop flavors, with mango, passionfruit, and grapefruit dominating the taste profile. The bitterness is well-balanced and not overpowering, allowing the fruity flavors to shine through. There is also a slight sweetness to the beer, likely from the malt bill, which provides a pleasant balance to the bitterness.

The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a medium body that coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. The carbonation is just right, providing a refreshing bite without being too fizzy.

Overall, Parish Brewing Co.'s DDH Ghost in the Machine is an outstanding beer that deserves all the accolades it has received. It is a beautifully crafted IPA that is both complex and balanced, with a flavor profile that will please both hop-heads and beer novices alike. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch IPA experience.","Apr 23, 2023"

Pours a pale pastel yellow with a coarse 0.5 finger white head. Nose is citrus, pear, and apple. All underripe. Actually a bit more muted than I thought it would be. Some cane sugar and starfruit in there as well. Beer opens grapefruit, pear, and apple. An interesting take on the tropical fruit flavor profile. The middle yields notes of citrus, a touch of grassiness, and more pear skin. End is more pear, apple, and citrus fruit. Finish bone dry with an aftertaste of citrus rind. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and foamy in the mouth and aggressive going down. Probably the dryest beer I've had to date. A long, lingering aftertaste.

Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,,Indiana,4.59/5,"Pours a turbid pineapple color with a creamy, dense two-finger white head that provides minimal lacing. The nose is a cornucopia of citrus and tropical fruit aromas, with trip oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, and passion fruit vying for attention, and there’s an herbal note as well.

The taste mirrors the nose, with the ripe oranges and passion fruit most prominent on my palate, and the herbal flavor is significant as well, but it’s the slightly creamy flavor that keeps this beer perfectly in balance and dangerously drinkable at 8.5% ABV.

The mouthfeel is the softer side, per the style, yet substantial enough to support a beer of this gravity. I would imagine when this beer was added to the database nearly four years ago, it knocked the socks off of beer nerds everywhere and for good reason, because this stands up exceptionally well to the breweries in the Northeast like Tree House and Trillium that have perfected this style.

Taste - Initially, I was surprised that this was not very sweet. I detected pine, citrus, fresh cut grass, and passionfruit. It was a little dank and spicy with a little bit of warmth at the end.

Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,,Iowa,4.79/5,"On tap at Toppling Goliath, served in a ""snulip"" glass. I found the profile quite similar to the regular 2022 KBBS: opaque blackish brown in color, garnet highlights, evanescent tan head. notes of cocoa, molasses, roast malt, licorice, espresso, cherry cola, maple syrup, and pipe tobacco. The bourbon barrel character was more up-front here than on the regular 2022. It also struck me as a bit sweeter and with a less ""chewier"" mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly, with a lingering note of espresso and a bit of tannic astringency. Very easy drinking as is the regular 2022. I'd like to have one or two of these to cellar. On second thought, no, I wouldn't. Who has time to wait?","Dec 04, 2022"
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout - Double Barrel Reserve,,,4.94/5,"4 oz pour at the brewery. Two (perhaps) relevant details: 1) the brewery had pre-poured a bunch of stouts due to expected demand, so I didn't see it right at the pour. If there was any head or foam, I didn't see it. 2) I had a glass of the OG KBBS right next to it, and it was great to compare details of the two. They are both world-class beers. The Reserve just had more of everything.

Rich black color with a red-brown ring around the edges due to the sunny taproom. No head present. Swirling it around, it's thicker but not heavy.

Smell is maple-y, warm boozy, and barrel. There's just a ton of stuff there. Definitely sweet-smelling . Coffee did not really present heavily to me. Compared to the original KBBS, the booze was strong (expected from the much higher ABV), but it was well-supported by other aromas.

Mouthfeel did not really coat and it swirled around easily. I expected the sweetness to make it more viscous, but that wasn't the case.

The taste is unreal. You get this sweet boozy maple (cola?) thing and then about 6 seconds later there's this swelling whoosh of oak that rides out slowly with the booze as an aftertaste of maple and chocolate settle in. I never pick up coffee as well in sweeter stouts, and that was certainly true here. Every sip makes you think, ""This is a fantastic beer.""

TG's ability to push the barrel flavor forward and then round it out with booze and sweet and flavor is just so impressive here. I could smell the maple on my upper lip for the next 5 hours. I didn't win a bottle of this one but I'm jealous of anyone who did. I've had beers that are this good, but probably none that are better. Just outstanding.","Dec 04, 2022"

Thick and warming feel.

Overall really glad to get a pour of this stuff at the brewery.

Blam! You can smell citrus, berries, stone fruits (tangerines, apricot, over ripe fruits...), grassiness. This beer's smell will hit you from a few feet away if your nose is clear and ready! 

Tastes amazing! Hops for days but not crazy bitter BUT it is 100+ IBUs?! Weird...how'd they do that? Is this just a big hazy West Coast IPA or a NEIPA? Don't know for sure and don't care...I just know they must have used a ton of citra hops to get it to this level of deliciousness and it's well-balanced...well, if well balanced means you like it hoppy with a dry mouth feel.

Indeed, the mouthfeel is lush and big but it still finishes dry. The malts stand up to the hops so it's balanced but it leans hoppy, but never offensive or overly piney.

This is an amazing beer and one of my favorite IPAs! I finally got it here in Southern California at Aldi in Murrieta, CA! :)

*NOTE: This proves a single hop Citra beer can be amazing. I know there are other really good citra only beers, but this is on another level. I think Mosaic is the one hop I might choose if I could have only one single--hopped IPA on a tap, but this proves citra can stand up (it just doesn't get as funky or berry flavored as mosaic, in my opinion).","Apr 11, 2023"

King Sue,,Texas,4.57/5,"Date on can: 01/05/2023, only about two months old at the time of drinking. Should be fresh!

Pours a hazy, juicy golden in color with two fingers of frothy foam on top with decent lasting potential. Carbonation is hard to see, though if you swish the beer around you'll see some medium sized bubbles rising up. There's a bit of lacing as you drink, some clings, some slides. Head retention could be better, but otherwise this looks the part.

Very fruity on the nose; mostly pineapple and mango. There's also a piney, ""evergreen"" aroma to round it out. The malts provide a sweet, bready aroma in the background. Pretty classic.

Taste follows the nose well as this is quite fruity, although I do pick up a lot of orange and some grapefruit in addition to the pineapple and mango. The evergreen/pine comes mostly towards the swallow. The malts stay mostly out of the way, though there is some biscuity flavors in there. I also detect some herbal/tea-like notes. Mostly grapefruit rind on the tongue after the swallow. Alcohol is masked nicely.

This is medium bodied with ample chewiness. The carbonation is pretty average without too much zest. The finish is fairly dry and this is a bit of a palate wrecker. It's very easy to drink, however, especially considering the ABV. Quite smooth.

Full disclosure: I'm getting a bit tired of hazy IPAs. That said, this is definitely near the top in terms of quality, and it's amazing to think that all that flavor comes from just a single hop. It's tasty, complex and drinkable, though I probably wouldn't seek it out unless I was craving a NEIPA. I tried the Psuedo Sue first, and this one is definitely better, especially in terms of mouthfeel, but it obviously also packs more flavor. Happy to check it off the list. Cheers!","Mar 07, 2023"

Tastes sweet up front like a mashup of orange juice and caramel, with tangerine, papaya, grapefruit, guava juice, biscuit, graham cracker, a lot of different fruit notes that are hard to distinguish, and herbal flavors like tea leaf, coriander and mint.

Feel: Medium to lighter bodied. Finishes very clean and smooth. Not too heavy and creamy, nor too light. Lingering lemon, pineapple with some citrus pith and flower astringency left on the palate. (4.50)

Overall: The Charizard of Craft Beer. The fruit flavors really hit the mark. The green melon, pineapple, citrus, and mango flavors are perfect and have the appropriate balance of pith and sweetness. Plus the body is just right. Not too creamy, nor too airy. Not a fan of the NE style, but this beer gives credence to the style. Still prefer the body of Pseudo Sue, but this might be the OG NEIPA.

King Sue,,Florida,4.9/5,Never have I rated a beer this highly. Absolutely superb beer. Had it with my girlfriend two months ago and couldn’t wait to come back and have more. At airport Marriott bistro 79. This beer now tops my significant nationwide list. Right out of the tap the initial appeal is the light hazy color. Smell is firm with true honey wheat notes. Just an incredibly smooth taste. They call it a double but not at all overwhelming. Taste is subtle honey grapefruit initially and smooth finish with no aftertaste. Mouthfeel is the right amount of tart. Just great on every level. Hope I can find it in florida. Highly recommend.,"Nov 04, 2022"

Coconut Vibes,,Missouri,4.47/5,"Pours black with a still look. It has oily legs as you swirl the glass. Aroma is coconut water and soy sauce. Toasted coconut, chocolate, caramel, and roasty and toasty malts all come thru, leaning lightly towards 'sweet'. Flavor profile is the same, big coconut water mixed in with hearty toasty and roasty malts. Chocolate comes on at the finish. Soy sauce permeates the middle, distracting a touch from the rest of the profile. Mouth feel is thick, creamy, and decadent. Overall, big and bold, with a clear and intentional focus on coconut, as the label would suggest. It's a soothing pillow of coconut. 

Poured from a 750mL bottle. Reviewed from notes.","Feb 07, 2022"
Coconut Vibes,,Missouri,4.1/5,"750ml bottle. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lace on the glass.

Coconut Vibes,,Idaho,4.66/5,"750ml bottle at share. Inky black pour, ring of beige head. Aroma is coconut, chocolate, roasty, nutty. Taste pronounces the almonds a bit more, with plenty of lush coconut and chocolate flavors to nail the Almond Joy vibe. Superb!","Dec 19, 2021"

Coconut Vibes,,Connecticut,5/5,"Easily my favorite non-BA coconut stout. It's basically coconut candy in a well done base stout. The coconut aroma stops you in your tracks. Mouth feel is on the thicker side for a non-BA, gets better as it warms. Easy 5/5.","Jan 12, 2021"

Coconut Vibes,,Virginia,4.42/5,"Batch 3. Bottled a few months ago.

A: Pours black, viscous, with a smattering of dark brown head that dissipates to a razor-thin ring almost immediately. No lacing, no retention to speak of. A few flecks of coconut on the surface. 

S: Toasted coconut and dark chocolate bar, light roast, vanilla extract, and sweetness.

T: Thick, melted dark chocolate, toasted coconut, a touch of tannic roastiness on the middle of the tongue, vanilla bean. Medium sweetness brights out the dessert-like character. 

M: Extremely thick, full bodied, chewy, with light carbonation—a bit lower than needed to cut the body. Just a wisp of alcohol heat. 

O: Not mindblowing, but pretty tasty dessert beer. The thickness and sweetness limit the drinkability, making it difficult to enjoy more than a small taster’s worth.","Sep 09, 2020"
Coconut Vibes,,Texas,4.78/5,"Sweet AF, but you know that going in... the coconut is on point, body thick and oily, still super sweet. While the coconut is prominent, there is a lot more going on with bittersweet chocolate, muted coffee and some sweetness. Overall a great beer but definitely for sharing.","Aug 22, 2020"
Coconut Vibes,,New York,4.28/5,"This one pours a syrupy and inky looking dark black color, with basically no head or lacing. 

This smells like creamy and sweet toasted coconut, chocolate syrup, fudge, vanilla, and caramel.

It’s called Coconut Vibes and sweet coconut is definitely the dominant vibe here - like a coconut cream truffle or something along those lines. It’s got a wonderfully lovely creamy flavor to it, with just a touch of roast and spice to prevent any impression of a cloying beer. There’s obviously a lot of coconut here, but it’s not overdone - too much of everything is just enough, as Bob Weir sometimes sings. I imagine the BA version of this is dynamite.

This is thick, creamy and just slightly syrupy, with a lower and soft level of carbonation. 

This series represents delicious beers that are maybe a touch easier to get the main Side Project stouts, and that’s something to be celebrated.","Aug 02, 2020"
Coconut Vibes,,Vermont,4.5/5,Super sweet syrup. Thick like a BA stout. Very one-note but tasty.,"Nov 17, 2019"
Coconut Vibes,,Ohio,3.97/5,"Motor oil black with burnt brown edges and no head but for some floating chunks of coconut lipids.

Taste is waffle cone and tangy chocolate malt with a touch of raisin. As it warms it develops some serious toffee and peanut brittle, but it's syrupy thick and sticky, and pretty cloying with a warming heat. I also get a little molasses on the nose.

It's no where near as good as the previous Coffee Shop Vibes, and it doesn't touch the Kane Coconut ANTEAD I had in the same sitting. Considering this batch 2 bottle got a huge amount of hype, it's just another STL bottle that didn't live up to it.","Sep 09, 2019"
Coconut Vibes,,Oregon,4.23/5,"750ml bottle, batch 2. Supposedly 4x the coconut addition of the first batch. It shows, it has way too much coconut in it, which doesn't mesh very well with the big chocolate fudge of the base beer. It is too intense on both counts, which normally is not a bad thing but they just don't really balance well with each other. It's too sweet and weirdly cloying. Full bodied, creamy, thick and viscous- but the coconut and the imperial stout just didn't work. I think it just needed the barrel aging to really smooth it out and add something to break up the weird duopoly of sweet coconut and sweet chocolate malt.","Aug 11, 2019"
Coconut Vibes,,Tennessee,4.21/5,"Very viscous like motor oil on the pour. Opaque with a modest dark tan head that settled quickly. Aroma was full-on pastry with rich chocolate, salted caramel, faint coconut, and vanilla. Taste followed. Very thick and dessert-like. Flavors were bright, although on my palate the coconut tasted more like a sweet marshmallow compliment to the chocolate. Delicious and well-executed but I prefer less sweetness on the end.","Jul 27, 2019"
Coconut Vibes,,Minnesota,4.8/5,"It is absolutely mind-blowing how thick this beer is - it's surprising that a Russian imperial stout bears absolutely not trace of hop or bitterness... it's smooth, thick, and rich, with loads of chocolate and coconut. I'd love to drink this every day, but it's so much sensory overload that it blows up your palate. Also, diabetes.

Incredible beer - absolutely world class. The only coconut beer that I've had that is even on a level is barrel aged Coco Vibes. This one is the beer to beat.","Jun 04, 2019"

Society & Solitude #4,,Germany,4.68/5,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a full and hazy yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving a good amount of lacing. A few floaters are visible.

Smell: Soft notes of orange, tangerine, mango and lychee. 

Taste: Citrusy body with hints of orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium fruity sweetness paired with a lightly tingling zesty bitterness and a marzipan-like finish.

Feel: Juicy, smooth and very silky. Medium carbonation. 

Overall: Beautifully crafted DIPA with a soft and fruity aroma, a complex yet nicely balanced taste, and a lovely mouthfeel. This is a great beer and a joy to drink.","Apr 25, 2022"

Unsweetened malt with peaches and fruit punch on the initial smell. There's a touch of alcohol aroma. The dominating nose is black pepper.

It is very cloudy but it is not murky, it looks so in the picture but the edges have a slight clarity to them. Perfectly white creamy looking head, some generous lacing with almost every sip. 

The smell is so so lively, like bursting out of the glass. Super pungent peach, citrus, also hints of tropical fruits. 

The taste follows the nose mainly in the same peachy citrus I first got from the nose. There’s also a nice grassiness that I didn’t pick up on in the nose along with the slightest touch of herbal green flowers. 

This beer has a medium body but it is such a soft and pleasant beer to drink. Semi dry finish with a medium bitterness that goes down so smooth and clean.","Jul 03, 2021"

F: Dry, crisp despite the low carb. Near perfection.

Overall: A delicous and well balanced NEIPA. Galaxy and Citra hops seem to pair very well together. I would recommend this beer to anyone that loves a tropical fruit dominant hop character.","Aug 15, 2020"
Society & Solitude #4,,Virginia,4.31/5,"Canned on 01/28/20. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint. Thanks for trying Bethany — purchased on a February road trip by my friend but delivery shattered by COVID-19 lockdown.

A: Hazy glowing golden with 2-3 finger off-white, stick, frothy head with good retention and drapes of lacing.

S: Despite the age the aroma is still pretty strong, not I can smell it from 5 feet away strong but structured with pineapple, guava, passionfruit, and dank herbal undertone.

T: Still very hoppy but probably a shadow of itself and still very enjoyable. Pineapple, passionfruit, lemongrass, ruby grapefruit, and tangerine come through strongest with more dank, herbal, grassy character in the finish. Moderately bitter with fruity yeast esters.

M: Soft throughout with high drinkability (gulpability) with soft carbonation but fairly dry finish for the NEIPA style. 

O: While I wish I had it fresher, it wasn’t to be but still tastes great and will look forward to another chance in the near future! Thanks Bethany and Christian!","Jul 30, 2020"

Society & Solitude #4,,New York,4.65/5,"On tap at Arts and Craft Beer Parlor, NYC. 
The color is redolent of freshly squeezed orange juice. Turbid in appearance with a layer of chill haze. No significant head, rather, minimal scattered bubbles on the surface, yet, there is lots of lacing throughout.
Intense hops driven aroma that highlights a varied bouquet of fruit and pungent herbal hops. In the 1st phase, there are notes of oranges, grapefruit, pear, and papaya. A light cracker malt aroma throughout. In the 2nd phase, herbaceous and dank notes of pine resin and grass. 
The taste opens with a soft graham cracker malt sweetness accompanied by juicy notes of alcohol laced tropical, citrus and orchard fruit. Fruity and delicious flavors of grapefruit, orange, papaya, mango, peach and pear throughout. In the middle palate, a developing bitterness adds balance, along with notes of grass, pine resin and herbal dank. Furthermore, although juicy, the palate has dryness. Throughout the drink, the bitterness increases, as does the alcohol spice, to its credit, without booziness. 
Medium to full bodied, gently carbonated and with a smooth mouthfeel, due perhaps to the addition of wheat and oats. The finish is dry and resiny with a lingering bitterness. 
This is one of those beers in which the taste lingers in both the mouth and in the memory. I really hope to have it again sometime because it was wonderful.","Oct 17, 2019"

L : JUICE. Pure juice. Tons of acidic head clinging on in ropes beautifully. The glass looks like we're taking a ride through a car wash!

S : Peach pit. Slight dank socks. Amazing dank wet grass. Slight hash pipe. Wow, wow, wow. 

T : At first, it didn't catch me much. That first sip yields a lot of wet grass and dry grass alike, with some pine and socks, but hold it...hold it...the finish...the finish brings ALL of the flavors forth. Once it's swallowed, the beer completely coats the palate and brings the most amazing papaya-mango-orange juice blast that sits, and sits, and settles on the palate. Incredible, guys. 

F : Juicy, acidic, slightly resinous but not overly so, more acid, juice, resin, it continues....resiny finish. Moderate carb, moderate alcohol warmth - just enough to warm you up.

Society & Solitude #4,,New Jersey,4.52/5,"Look: This beer pours an opaque, hazy, golden yellow white grapefruit juice color. It does not have that murky, pond water unattractiveness that comes along with some NEIPA. No visible carbonation. A fluffy white head that sits a finger high in my stemmed wine glass, settling down to a thin layer across the top while leaving a thick blanket of lacing in its wake. 

Smell: Meaty and cheesy upon first whiff, with some green, dank, grassy and even skunky notes. As the beer sits for a few minutes the tropical juice notes really come out, including mango, one of my favorite IPA aromas described as crushed sweet tart candy. Orange citrus. There is a sweet bready malt aroma. 

Taste: Up front orange citrus, followed by tons of berry including blueberry and strawberry. Sweet, bready malt flavor. The beer pleasantly bitters out mid-palate, with lingering notes of fresh cut grass, grapefruit juice and a pithy dryness. 

Mouthfeel: Moderate level of carbonation. Super smooth and creamy. 

Overall: It’s been a while since I’ve had a Hill Farmstead IPA and this is freaking fantastic. I love the creamy, candy and tropical fruit juicyness up front balanced out by the grassy, pithy and dry bitterness on the finish. Tons of berry flavor which was unexpected and thoroughly enjoyed.

Lou Pepe - Framboise,,Colorado,4.6/5,"a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together. its incredible stuff, worth the wait, and as good as anything i have had from these guys really, every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou. deep dusty brick red in color, dense with fruit here, not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers, and with a fizzy lazy head, not super robust there. the nose is mind melting for me, pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness, turbid wheaty aged hop base, tons of oak and brett, a well developed wild acidity as well, this is rather piquant, and then of course all the berry, as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face, as intense as can be. i smell it for awhile before i taste it, so complex and mouthwatering and inviting. great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start, with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it, tart and red winey towards the finish, a little sweet from the fruit, still malty in a lambic sense, and really brightly acidic and interesting. the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets, and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned. the raspberries are perfect with it, and really bold in this beer. the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible. beautiful lambic, famous for a reason, and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world. this is the cream!","May 13, 2018"

Lou Pepe - Framboise,,Sweden,4.7/5,"2014 vintage at the brewery.

Pours a deep red, with fine foam.

Smell has a crazy amount of raspberries, complimented by a little bit of funk and some elderflower.

Taste is moderately sour, but sooo refreshing and fruity. Raspberries, some lime and a bit of hay are the main notes, and it's so deep and complex. The flavors just keep evolving as it warms. Awesome stuff!

Mouthfeel is thin and prickly.

Overall, an amazing fruit lambic, so complex and enjoyable.","Sep 19, 2017"

Lou Pepe - Framboise,,Virginia,4.64/5,"750 ml, 2012 (bottled/released fall 2015). Pours between brick and blood red, slightly hazy, and with minimal head. Nose takes you down two roads. Fresh and acidic/preserved cherries and raspberries and ice cream come through. Alongside, dandelions, hay, Brett, and tart apple. Fruit is amazing compared to Rose de Gambrinus. I think this will be my first ever 5 for nose. Flavor has acidity and intensity of straight raspberry juice paired with funky lemon peel and a fresh herbal greenery that is hard to place. Almost like an intense mixed drink. Prickly crisp carbonation. Funky monkey this is a good beer, even compared to other Cantillon beers. Honestly, the intensity will make this 750 ml bottle an all afternoon affair.","Mar 18, 2017"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Colorado,4.68/5,"L: Pours a very strong pale orange yellow with no head and no lacing on the glass.

T: A strong Brett and apricot mixes with lots of sour and tart, and a nice strong toasted oak. Amazing golden sour.

F: Smooth medium body and good carbonation.

O: This is a world class golden sour ale.","Apr 30, 2023"

Abricot Du Fermier,,Indiana,4.4/5,"Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible. 

Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison. 

Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.

Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.

Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this.","Aug 07, 2022"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Missouri,4.55/5,"Pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. Transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head never forms. Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity. 

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle. Blend #5.","Jan 23, 2022"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Illinois,4.75/5,"Truly excellent beer. Not too funky, but plenty of saison characteristics. Pleasant apricot flavor. Dry finish. Aging in wine barrels gives it a subtle booziness.","Dec 11, 2021"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Texas,4.9/5,Great brew!,"Oct 31, 2021"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Hawaii,4.5/5,So good! So much fruit with a tart bite,"Jan 02, 2021"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Maine,4.52/5,"Batch 5 - 750ml bottle - Poured into a white wine stem at 40°F and allowed to warm up.

Pours a deep, foggy, apricot orange, with absolutely zero head formation, and no sign of effervescence. A couple of tiny floaties can be seen, looking like pulp in fresh-squeezed orange juice. A few spots of lace cling to the glass, but otherwise, the ale is lifeless. Pretty colour though.

Nose: That instantly recognisable Side Project base is instantly recognisable. A nice toasty grain backbone, tons of funky farmhouse wet hay bales, musty wet oak, tons of leather, dusty attic, musty stone cellar, mineralic rover stones, dried leaves, petrichor, mineral-rich white wine (Riesling, Pinot Gris), pitty fruit notes of cherry, plum, apricot, peach, etc.., wood shavings, magnolia blossoms, gardenia, lilac, honeysuckle, deep bretty funk, with some sweaty, horsey, stable notes, some lemon, lemon zest, and lemon oil acidity, and heaps of sweet, saturated stone fruit notes. This is seriously complex. 

Palate: AdF greets the palate with a blast of minerality and acidity. The acidity ia actually fairly tame, leaning more lacto than pedio, but it's compounded by this insane level of minerality. Sea shells, stone, aspirin, vitamin C - it almost lends a gooozie salinity. It all explodes at once, and it's hard to pull complexity out. Plenty of white oak, vinous cask notes (almost a Rosé), some farmy wet hay, dried grass, big fresh lemon and even some white grapefruit, tart pear, green apple, unripe gooseberry, underripe nectarine, peach, and lots of apricot, and strangely, some dark fruit shows up - overripe cherry, plum, and blackberry, which pair up with the stone fruit, and quickly dry out, seeing the acidity disappeared in the finish. This allows more oak, cereal grain, and some sweaty, musty brett to reemerge, turning back into musty wet wine cask - again, with this almost cherry note underneath it. The finish is bone dry, ultra clean, and lifts off nicely. 

Mouthfeel/Body: The body here is fantastic. Like most of these Side Project fruits, the ABV is at 8%, and it's right where it should be. Enough grain to lend some body and not be thin, but crisp enough to be a light-bodied ale, further lifted by that acidity and overall brightness. There's a bit of sweetness in here, but it eventually dries out completely. Effervescence is moderate. That is, it's a bit sparse, and not champagne-like. Spritzy, but neither fizzy nor lacking. Not puckering, but definitely sour. 

Overall: This is a beautiful beer. In a lot of ways, it's similar to Fuzzy. Fuzzy is a more complete beer. This has more flavour, more fruit, more acidity, but less oak, less character, but more flavour. If stone fruit sours are your jam, and you don't mind the bite, this is just a must try. Perhaps a bit more funk and complexity on the palate (like the nose) would improve this, but as-is, batch 5 is still delightful.","Dec 11, 2020"
Abricot Du Fermier,,New Jersey,4.02/5,"A: An upbeat melon, carrot orange pour with mild yellow inserts. The collar is practical and comes slightly off-white with adequate retention

S: The scent is energetic with rustic acidity, and upfront leggings in Riesling stone fruit: cherries, apricots, peaches, nectarines. The development is delayed from sharp acidity, but eventually picks up on the courtyard subtleties in oaked woodland, wheat orchards, cellared satchel, and peppered haystacks against the tempered/relaxed wine barrel

T: More shaded barrel on taste peering alongside the wild horse blanket and funky greenwood. Tartness remains on crisp apricot, earthy pine needles, and honey fruit leather to skins of crunchy gold apple pears. There is a peppery, cutting sour bite throughout, but not crumbling to palate or too forceful/cut-throat with slight ventilation. Intensity varies and contracts in lapses, as involvedness constructs in temperature to warming cedar, mildewed pastures, white grape-vanilla jam, and softened fruit-nut bread

M: Light, effervescent feel with medium carbonation and a prickly, peppery spice that ends parched

O: A fair bit of workings coming out of a matured (2+ yrs.) Blend #3, where stability bobs thru piercing acidity: gravitates more sensibly over time to composure","Sep 29, 2020"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Missouri,4.25/5,"Gold In color and hazy in complexion. There’s a fingernail of off white around the rim. The aroma is an assault of apricots and a touch of brettanomyces.

Appearance: 5 - a glowing apricot orange. Beautiful white head still maintaining a strong presence after several minutes.

Nose: 5 - SOUR! Remember when classic saisons weren't sour? I recall that actually being a thing. This one will be super sour. Apricot in there too.

Taste: 5 - ok, so it's not insanely sour, but the apricot certainly comes to the fore. And that barnyard funk they're always talking about? Really shines on the back end.

Mouth: 5 - oh lordy! I'm amazed at how thick this is. Like it takes a couple swallows to get it all down.

Overall: 5 - this is a real standout. Wow!","May 20, 2020"

Abricot Du Fermier,,Illinois,4.75/5,"This is the best sour saison I have ever had. Not even up for debate. The apricot is the perfect star for all of the delicately balanced flavors in the original.

Abricot Du Fermier,,Rhode Island,4.59/5,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into a SP stemmed wine glass. 

Pours a hazy orange body with a fluffy white head that reduces to leave leggy lacing and minimal retention.

Aromas are potent and pungent - ripe stone fruits, apricot, a little grassy and floral, white wine, tart but not sour smelling. 

On the tongue, it's pretty tart with lots of stone fruit, apricot, citrus, lactic acid, oak, funky on the finish and rounded out with wine and oak. Dry, crisp, easy to drink. 

This was a real winner - the aroma stole the show but the taste was world class.","Aug 23, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Minnesota,4.75/5,"Pours a beautiful golden - surprising clarity, I'd expected more yeast suspension. Immediately after popping the cap, apricot permeated the air - it has a tremendous nose, clean and tart and fruity. The taste follows suit - tart, sour, full of apricots. Rich, yet not the yeasty beast that I had anticipated. Finish is fairly clean as well, which is surprised me a bit. This is quite likely one of my top 3 beers from Side Project at this point - I'd gladly trade for more any day!","Aug 18, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Massachusetts,4.52/5,"750 ml poured into a teku at a share. 

Look is golden orange. In the glass, it resembles the color of an apricot. Really great looking beer. Minimal head, no lacing and good carb. 

Aroma is of fresh apricots followed by some funkiness. Really smells great. 

Taste is very apricot prevalent with funk and tartness bringing up the rear. Super balanced as nothing overpowers. Also, where's the 8%? This drinks like something half the abv. 

Feel is light and bubbly as you'd expect for this style. 

Overall, another fantastic SP fruited saison. They do them right and this AdF is no exception.","Aug 15, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Virginia,4.15/5,"Blend #3.

A: Pours a pale orange, nearly opaque, with a half finger of bright white head. Pretty good retention and a bit of lacing.

S: Juicy stone fruit (apricot), horseblanket funk, oak and a bit of spice (clove), light white wine and tropical fruit. Pretty appealing.

T: Medium-high sour dominates the flavor, with a decent dose of apricot, a bit of vanilla, funk, and rounded white wine. Medium length finish.

M: Medium-light body with medium carbonation. 

O: The fruit is a nice addition to Saison du Fermier, but the sourness is a bit high. I definitely prefer the base.","Jun 24, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Colorado,4.39/5,"this is really good, no doubt about it, but not as good as they say it is i dont reckon, and once again a side project beer doesnt quite live up to its hype. their culture has trended super sour lately, and this is another expression of that, just really acidic beer, complex still, still lots of nuance, bretty funk and oak and all, but its the bacterial intensity that takes over this one and makes it a hard large bottle to drink, even split a couple of ways. i really like to let these types of beers warm up a little bit, but not here, its best when its colder, with temperature comes acidic intensity thats hard on the teeth and belly. i like all the apricot of course, about as natural as it gets, super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit, very forward and incredibly natural and delicious, the authenticity is through the roof. i kind of wanted to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile, which is tannic and heavily oaky, but not as red wine forward as i might have thought for cabernet. all the wood is nice, subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow, killer with the apricots, peach juice notes, even green apple and white grape wrapped up in here, lots going on, but instead of mellowing into a slow tart bretty funkiness like i wish it did, the sourness cranks and disrupts the delicate beauty, it finishes harsh and big. i mean, in all respects this is great beer, but it just doesnt stand with the best wild beers in the world to my palate, maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree, but i think its a little too much, unflattering to the fruit, and at $45 a bottle it just doesnt do it for me...","Jun 06, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Illinois,4.59/5,"Pours a beautiful straw - light orange color. Pitch white frothy head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a sudsy ring around the glass. Nose is ripe apricot, stone fruit, prickly pear, getting some oak, barnyard funk, bready yeast. Taste. Taste is follows the nose, getting apricots, green apple, lemon, a little grassy note. Tart, but not puckering. Acidic, but not harsh. Great smooth pillowy mouthfeel. Soft on the palate. Overall a fantastic fruited Saison. Everything you would want, very well balanced.","May 05, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Oregon,4.53/5,"Abricot Du Fermier, Batch #3, is beautiful. It's what you hope for based on its name. Glowing bright yellow, smooth and even soft looking. A fluffy white cloud is perched above the bright sunshine from below, and it's making me thirsty.

Cracked wheat and an acidic sour aroma is complimented, not overpowered, by wonderful levels of oak and the star of this show, the sweet, juicy apricots. Cut grass, hay, and more sunshine, as if wet wooden panels are being steamed by it in the morning. It's complex, yet beautifully simple.

And the flavors are even better. I can almost say they are identical, but the texture must play a factor here as it is velvety soft, and carries them remarkably. Everything you could ask for in a rustic wild Saison. Tart, but not puckering, light, but not something to guzzle, and full of all the right flavors of wood, hay, wheat, bread crusts, barn funk, and in this case the simple introduction of apricot.

This is a delicious beverage. One that I never even knew I wanted to try, but couldn't be more excited once I laid eyes on this bottle. I knew it was something special, and it is. I want more. If you can get it, consider yourself lucky and do so. Cheers.","Apr 30, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,California,4.21/5,Nice sour qualities but on par with a lot of apricot sours. I dig the white wine barrel qualities. Quite full feel for a wild ale. Nice overall but nothing mind blowing particularly for the hype surrounding this one. As this warms the sour qualities become quite abrasive. Glad I split this between 4.,"Apr 26, 2018"
Abricot Du Fermier,,Ohio,4.02/5,"Super vibrant orange, almost neon, with a persistent lumpy off-white foam that settles to a thick collar and thin film.

Aroma has faint notes of various fruits like apple, orange and apricot, all on toast, with some funk, peppery oak and cheese that's kind of reminiscent of Gose, even with accents of seaweed and salt. I also detect some PEZ towards the tail end of a whiff. However, as it warms, the toast transitions to a breadiness that becomes completely overwhelming at the end of the session.

Having just had a full bottle of Apricot Casey Family Preserves, that one tasted more fresh, herbal and orchard-like. AdF is sharper, more sour, a little less fruit expressive, but with a bit more oak. The sourness nears vinegar at times, but avoids it thankfully. It's also kind of orangey and grassy with some peach candy in the swallow. Finally, funk is more present than Casey's, albeit lightly so.

The medium body has a nice froth that fades to a crisp fizz. This is super tingly and salivatingly tangy, with a semi-dry finish, but a slight burn on the way down increases the longer you go at it.

Cable Car,,Alabama,4.55/5,"2020 Vintage.

Clear golden coloration; soft white head of carbonation settles in a thin ring around the beer.

The nose opens with a musty sweetness and candied lemon peel. Really nice balance of funk and citrus.

The palate is tart and predominantly fruity, with a bit of a tightening pucker on the back of the palate and a long, mildly acidic finish. Nice juiciness to the overall profile.

T: Initial bright refreshing champagne-like start, it’s a split second of silence as your taste buds reset.

Flavors of sour cherries, nectarines, kumquats, apricots and plum emerge and give way to more complex flavors of oak, black pepper and tobacco as it stimulates your salivary glands, drying your mouth and making you thirst for more. 

F: Medium bodied

O: One of the smoothest sours I have ever tasted! People celebrate with champagne, if this bubbled like champagne, this would replace champagne. This is delish! If a sour is a sour, this is a refined sour. This is a well cellared vintage sour ready to drink at its peak!","Jun 30, 2020"

Cable Car,,Colorado,4.47/5,"October 16th, 2015 - This 2014 Cable Car is nothing short of a work of art. A gorgeous rich blonde color, the experience starts with the aroma. Oh sweet, heavily ambrosia. Real vanilla and custard on the top, followed by a ginger note, then braised pear. The bouquet continues with clove, all-spice and a dash of saffron, and finally a cooling aroma of oatmeal. The flavor definitely distinguishes this beer as a sour ale, but the balance between acidity and other flavors is masterful. A long saffron taste pairs with the sourness and is followed by a lemon zest aftertaste. Between sips my mouth warmths with the taste of shortbread, but that breaks with each sip as well, as muscat grape cleanses the palate to make way for each new round of the complex flavors.

Misc.: N/A

Saw that Toronado would be tapping this gem Thursday earlier in the week as part of Toronado’s 10th anniversary and things worked out where I could sneak over from work after lunch. Had no idea of the price until I paid. Really didn’t know the size of the glass either, initially thinking eight ounces then later thinking six. Either way, this beer was supposed to be a stud, coming in at No. 55 all-time on Beer Advocate. Scanning the QR code on their website after the fact, it read, “Good luck! We produced this limited release barrel aged sour blended beer for the 20th anniversary of the Toronado in San Francisco. A whopping 35 cases were made.”

Poured a golden clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy off-white head when I got it. Some bubbles creeping up from the bottom of the glass. World-class spotty lacing. World-class retention. Really great looking beer for a sour. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled funky tart, pear, apple, cherry, skunky vinegar, oak, white grape, white wine barrel, peach, lemon, light lime and Irish Spring soap. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste was better than the smell. Got green apple skin, pear, funky tart, light cherry vinegar, white grape, French oak barrel, lemon, lingering spice, apricot and light mixed berry. (Taste - 4.50)

Medium body. Oily texture. Lively carbonation. Astringent tart finish. (Feel - 4.50)

About as good as I hoped, although I feel like I overrated it slightly. (Overall - 4.50)

Oude Geuze Vintage,,Ohio,4.77/5,"Lightly foggy burnt orange to amber, nearly glowing, with a tall off-white foam head settling to unevenly airy, bubbly lumps that are somewhat translucent, translating more to a khaki hue, leaving tiny spots of lace on the glass.

Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape.

The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find.

It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop.

This one pours a slightly hazy dark orange color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like funky pear, orange rind, citrus, white wine, barnyard funk, oak, lemon peel, funky hay, and a slight acidic bite.

As expected, this is pretty much awesome. It's deeply funky, with citrus, lemon, lime, white wine, dry spice, oak, and pear skin. It's not necessarily better than the regular Oude Gueuze, but it's certainly excellent.

This is light bodied, clean, and not super sour, with a good drinkability. This is so deeply funky and complex, but it also somehow remains fairly approachable.

Oude Geuze Vintage,,Illinois,4.58/5,"750ml bottle, 2008 vintage, poured into a Drie Fonteinen fountains tumbler glass. Enjoyed on 1.28.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.

The beer pours a hazy and cloudy copper color, big foamy white head, good retention, great lace clings to the glass. The aroma is super frunky, excellent expression of that distinct Drie funk that is so earthy yet citrusy and complex, lightly floral and herbal notes come forward with oak, green aged hops with some soft wheaty grain. The aroma is super bright and delicate, a really excellent display of what Drie is capable of. The flavors are excellent as well, great funk, dry dirty leaves, musty oak, bright citrus and an excellent floral character lingers well with some soft grain. The mouthfeel is great, very lively and crisp that coats very well with a tart and dry finish.

Verdict: A stunning gueuze from Drie Fonteinen. Excellent complexity, beautiful expression of funk with tons of depth bringing out nuances of fruit, oak, spice and grassiness, really delicious and special stuff.","Aug 27, 2017"
Oude Geuze Vintage,,Germany,3.67/5,"Ogv 12 375ml on 172207

Pours a clouded amber color with a small, soon disappearing head, which is unusual for 3F's Geuze, which normally stays coated by a fluffy lacing the whole time.

Smells of oak, sweeter blue cheese, stale malts, earthen mushrooms and a wet cellar quality. The typical 3F funk settles also in, together with a nice lemon zest sourness, softer than on their regular Geuze. Leans heavily on the oaken barrel with an intriguing sweet and sour interplay on top.

Has a soft mouthfeel with a pleasant complexity to it, amped up by an effervescent finish, holding the sourness in balance.

Tastes aqueous, almost flat, with some wood bark and muted toffee malts. Turns more wooden during midpalate with an uncompromising lemon tartness during the finish. The beer ends utmost dry, with a lingering lemon zest tartness, revealing mushrooms, mold and cream cheese. 

Actually, this appears less balanced than the regular Geuze, especially next to A&G the OGV is just not as complex. Its late sourness is almost too much to take, overpowering everything else, with just a crisp lemon appearance cutting noteably through.","Jul 24, 2017"

A: Body is yellow to orange, with a light amber-ish tone. Beautiful body. Head is white, minor retention but a good persistency when it gets to the last 1mm thickness.

Zombie Dust,,Michigan,4.42/5,"*I am far from an expert; this is a newbie review *

if you are new to craft beers this review might steer you in the right direction as I don't understand half of what some of these more complex reviews are speaking to.

Beautiful Copper to Gold color depending on the lighting, not clear but not too cloudy either. thick fluffy white head that sticks around a while and has laced my glass nicely. Smells strongly of grapefruit and citrus with some floral notes. hits like a light American beer with a little bitter finish, but a good bitter as you'd expect from an actual grapefruit if you're a weirdo who eats them without sugar. mouthfeel, WTF? I guess a bit oilier than the light beers to which I have become accustomed but in a good way as in the finishing flavor sticks around for a minute after and has a nice fruitiness. 

I will definitely drink this again and look forward to giving some to friends that may not have tried these before, I think this one has a high rating for a reason. it goes down really smoothly. 

I'd slap your mother for a grapefruit covered in sugar right now (not my mother though, she doesn't play that shit)

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,New Hampshire,4.13/5,"From a 500ml bottle, dated 03/11/23. Served in a spiegelau tulip glass.

Pours a thin-appearing oak-brown with no obvious highlights. A generous finger of lush, coffee colored foam doesn’t last but maybe 20 seconds leaving a narrow collar and a rousable spatter of oily, super-slippery lacing.

Nose is… fruity? A sweet, candy-like coffee aroma and, totally unexpectedly, raspberry - which must be an olfactory hallucination, or at least how my brain is interpreting the combination of vanilla, cinnamon and chiles.

Taste is sweet but not heavily so, with a berry-like coffee bean flavour and that fruity mélange of cinnamon-vanilla-chile pepper that my brain persists in translating as ‘raspberry’ bringing a brightness and lightness which keeps the beer from tasting syrupy. A slick Cadbury-like milk chocolatey character becomes more evident as the beer warms accompanied by some heat from the chiles. There’s a very faint soy sauce quality in the aftertaste which doesn’t detract much.

Feel is oily-smooth and creamy-slick, medium bodied but a little light relative to the style with gentle, prickly carbonation. Chile heat builds up on the palate somewhat and amplifies the otherwise mild carbonation, lightening the mouthfeel further.

Overall, pretty good but maybe a little bit of a mixed bag. I won’t call the flavours ‘muddled,’ but it is a very ‘busy’ flavour profile which, weirdly, for my palate, comes across very fruity and raspberry-like.","Jun 14, 2023"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,Florida,3.88/5,"2022 pint can, chilled, left to warm. Flat black on the pour, thick, sticky, tiny bit of struggled foam that vanished fast.
Smells like cinnamon, vanilla, cacao nibs, and chilli peppers being muddled together.
Tastes the same. Just too much going on. Cloyingly sweet and thick, slightly gritty, too much cinnamon, and who needs hot peppers in their stout?
Overall, I’ve attended 5 Hunahpu’s Day celebrations at the CCB Spruce Street brewery over the years and have bought a bottle or can each time and come away thinking the same thing: nice novelty.,. but way too busy and quite over rated.","Mar 23, 2023"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,Connecticut,4.33/5,"2020 vintage received courtesy of @roguer. 

Appearance is typical for the style, which means it's a nice looking dark, dark brown with a half inch of tan colored head. Nice legs. Aroma is wonderfully rich and decadent, but not in an artificial way. Plenty of sweet molasses, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and some faint figs / raisins. That description doesn't do this any real justice, so in summary, this beer smells great. 

Taste is interesting. Nowhere near as sweet on the nose, with some naturally bitter cacao notes, cinnamon and pepper combining brilliantly with the base beer. The spiciness is Goldilocks.....just right. A bit less and they wouldn't be notable. A bit more and they would overpower. There's a really nice sweetness deep into the finish that helps add to the complexity of this beer. Fully bodies and smooth, leaving a really nice coating on the tongue with a pleasant alcohol warming. 

Overall this is excellent.","Mar 04, 2023"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,Massachusetts,4.31/5,"2018 vintage

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still","Sep 02, 2022"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,New York,4.42/5,"2020 ""Amalie Arena"" edition...large capped bottle.

Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.

Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.

Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.

Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity.","Apr 15, 2022"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,Maine,4.08/5,"2018 Vintage

750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!

Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75

Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25

Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0

Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25

Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75","Jul 09, 2021"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,Ohio,3.75/5,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time.","May 08, 2021"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,Colorado,4.62/5,"Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.

2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick.","Apr 18, 2021"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,New Jersey,4.54/5,"2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking.

S: Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, hints of peppers, and some vanilla.

M: This beer is thick and velvety on the palate. Carbonation is low but adequate for the style while the beer has a drying finish due to the ABV.
O: Overall this beer is fantastic. Great flavors and a killer amount of complexity make this a very enjoyable beer to drink. I've been sitting on this one for a bit but it doesn't seem to have fallen off at all. Really nice balance of flavors and very well integrated.

Smooth, silky, has some sticky sweetness despite how easy it is to drink. Chili and cinnamon balance with chocolate and vanilla, just enough booze for a complementary finish, and even mild notes of dark fruits like figs (not so much plum).

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,,California,4.44/5,"2017 Bomber. Thanks Adam and Jay! Had a great time and a great trade. 

Inky black from the bottle and into the Carpe Brew Em snifter. A thick brown ring forms and then recedes to about 1/2 finger, then to nothing. Slight legs streaking down the glass. 

Aromas of rich dark chocolate, tobacco, quite a bit of soy sauce though it's not off-putting, molasses, fig, and a bit of dark fruit as well. 

That soy sauce comes through on the flavor, with a little wet paper, could be the age, but beyond that I get tons of dried dark fruit, dried apricot, and then tobacco, molasses, black olives, caramel sauce, and dark chocolate. 

Feel is heavy, thick, mean, but never oversaturated with alcohol; just the right amount of heat falling down onto the tongue and warming the throat. 

Overall an incredible beer. I can't wait to try the BA variant.","Dec 08, 2019"

Big sugary notes, but they are balanced out by roasty and toasty malts. Mouth feel is thick and full, with a modest level of graininess. Overall, deep and expressive with loads of flavor.

Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime. The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Quite frothy, quickly dissipating, white head. Fairly murky, medium orange with some amber overtones, to the look. Mango, guava, candied tangelo peel, a little medium roast caramel malt, emerges out of the mix. Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmeg/allspice, or such, buried deep in the aroma. A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel, a bit of medium light toasted malt, underlying, and a whiff of guava/passion fruit, deep in the taste somewhere. There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly, glowing, Mandarin orange/tangelo peel bite. Definitely well done.","Nov 13, 2021"

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

Bright and turbid liquid reminiscent of unpasteurized yellow grapefruir juice with a solid head of white foam

Nice bright aromatics. Very much reminds me of candied citrus peels.

Taste is a very nice balance of herbal bitterness that verges on mint along with a peachy berry note that is reminiscent of bubble gum in some way. Very nicely balanced. Bitterness hangs around in the aftertaste. 

Feel is excellently full with a clean finish. Very nice.","Nov 08, 2022"
Haze,,Pennsylvania,4.64/5,"My favorite of the core beers. Slight peach underbelly, but that oh-so-balanced TH mouthfeel.

Haze,,Michigan,4.6/5,"Canned 7/18/22

Pours cloudy, juicy, deep orange with a lovely white, billowing head, and smells of bright citrus fruits - mandarin, grapefruit, and I also get a tinge of melon. 

The taste follows with a bright explosion of orange, papaya, and tangerine, coupled with a silky smooth mouthfeel. A great sipper.","Aug 11, 2022"

Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version.

Haze,,Colorado,3.59/5,"Lovely golden orange body; cloudy; thick head, white and sculpted and long lasting. An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate.

All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

I don't need to rate this with regards to taste, smell, mouth feel.... As soon as I took the first pull, I can tell you it was one of (if not the best) IPA's I've ever had.

Haze,,Germany,4.56/5,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a light hazy orange with a foamy white head leaving a good amount of lacing. No floaters visible.

Smell: Sweet orange and tangerine combined with tropical notes of papaya as well as some peach.

Taste: Orange, tangerine and grapefruit, also peach and papaya. Ripe, but not overripe. Medium sweetness, medium zestiness and a slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Very juicy. Generally smooth with nuanced sharp notes.

Overall: Beautifully balanced beer with a soft fruity body and some edges. While Very Hazy and Very Hhhazyyy were a bit to sharp for my taste, this one just hits the spot.","Mar 07, 2022"
Haze,,Massachusetts,4.42/5,"Had the perfect excuse to visit the treehouse this past weekend. Was meeting up with a friend in Western, MA before conquering the slopes in Vermont. This is an absolute dream of a tailgate beer. I have only had Haze one other time, the Brady return game to Foxboro when we were pleasantly surprised that Tree House was being sold in the stadium. My goodness, what a delicious liquid. Massive citrus nose with grapefruit notes and several other tropical flavors. Taking one of these down after a few runs was an absolute dream. Refreshing and smooth. And, yes, I brought a glass for the tailgate. Veteran move.","Feb 23, 2022"
Haze,,Massachusetts,4.27/5,"Impressive dome head which never recedes completely. Excellent lacing with a variety of streaks and spots. The liquid is cloudy with a dirty gold appearance.

Grapefruit rind aroma along with some green vegetal/fresh cut grass notes. The malt is hard to tease out, but I would say it's closest to light wheat bread.

There's a berry sweetness up front. Richer body with a neutral level of carbonation. The hop is pronounced but not overwhelming. It's closer to black pepper with a notable alcohol warmth in the swallow. The sweetness returns in the aftertaste, but dissipates first leaving the peppery finish.","Feb 11, 2022"
Haze,,Illinois,4.21/5,"So maybe I made mistake of having very hazy first, but this one, while good, is so much like hundreds of other neipa's I have had. Murky darker yellow hazy body with a huge white head, spotted lacing. Big grapefruit and citrus with light pineapple lead the nose. Taste is much the same, some tangerine additions are nice. Body is medium-light with decent brightness and smoothness, not the most lush neipa ever. Does hide the abv very well","Jan 06, 2022"
Haze,,New Jersey,4.27/5,"Pours a fairly light straw color, perfect foamy white head. Aroma is citrusy, grassy, earthy, slightly dank. Flavor is sharp citrus, lemon candy, spicy grapefruit pith.

Major aroma alert: Pineapple, oranges, mandarins, melon and juicy fruit gum.

Juicy taste-big juicy taste. Maybe not as distinct as the nose. Citrus juice, pineapple. Also some citrus rind bitterness. Light earthy notes. Incredibly well-balanced juice and bitterness.

Soft but thick, full-bodied mouthfeel. Balanced bitterness and juice aftertaste. Low to medium carbonation.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

A: The beer is a very hazy dark gold color, with a large white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.

M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.

Doppelganger,,Massachusetts,4.4/5,"Canned 2/15/21, ""I have read a book about me reading the book I am reading"" stamped on the bottom

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together

Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick

This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score. Really good stuff here!","Mar 02, 2021"

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the tropical fruit and citrus, quickly followed up by the dank, herbal, and earthy tones. Moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit and citrus

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth

16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.

Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.

Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer.","Mar 06, 2022"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,Germany,4.49/5,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.

Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.

Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,Indiana,4.6/5,"I pop the top and take a gander. Golden color in the can, and there’s dank hop aromas wafting up to my schnoz. We are on the hop train, baby!!!

A fairly aggressive pour reveals very hazy golden color beer with a sudsy bone white head. Gorgeous beer. Meanwhile, my schnoz is being assaulted by dank citrus aromas, primarily tangerine and grapefruit, with some juicy pineapple and a touch of berry. I’m guessing a Mosaic- and/or Citra-hopped IPA/DIPA of the NE-style.

The taste is all about the dank - tangerine, touch of grapefruit, delicious pineapple, and more berry flavor than indicated by the nose, and a hint of pilsner malt. Most of all, this is JUICY. Very refreshing, too, but there’s a smidge of alcohol present, so I’m locking in on a DIPA that features the Mosaic hop.

Still really respectable, but not as tropical and fruity as I was expecting. Smooth finish, not too heavy or syrupy, with some lingering hoppy bitterness. This was can #1 of a 4 pack and has been stored cold the entire time, so I’ll definitely give it another shot and maybe see if it changes over time.

Smell- Huge citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, papaya and passion fruit), nectarine/peach, a bit of melon and berries, bready malt, little pine, some herbal/floral notes.

Taste- Seriously juicy citrus and tropical fruit, nectarine and peach skin, berries, some dank melon, grainy malt, negligible pine and some other herbal/floral hop notes.

Feel- Medium/light bodied and fairly dry and crisp, somewhat sweet and sticky up front with a lingering slightly bitter finish. Moderate/light carbonation on the tongue.

O- Except for the appearance, this is a homerun. Very crushable at 6.6%, more like an IPA than a pale ale.","Jul 06, 2020"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,California,4.68/5,"I don’t know. I really don’t. Like, who cares? You might as well imprison me like Paul Newman working a chain gang, or tell me that the world has been destroyed like when Charleston Heston was messing around with a bunch of apes. I mean... yes. And I also mean...wow! This thing hits on all levels like James Dean driving a car and hitting the breaks just before it drives off of of a cliff.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,Idaho,4.26/5,"16 ounce cans at share. I hit the Trillium trifecta tonight, getting to try three of their double dry hopped ales. The Fort point was no exception. Very well-crafted, citrusy, fruity, with a nice lingering bitterness that seems to go on forever. Juicy and silky smooth.","Nov 01, 2019"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,Massachusetts,4.56/5,"Dated 6/19/19 on the bottom of the can, 6 weeks since brewing.

Pours an extremely hazy, nearly opaque pale yellow with a finger of fluffy head. Nose bursting with candied peach, pineapple, mango, resin, fresh herbaceousness, lychee, Portuguese breadiness, hint of bubblegum, slight mushroomy earthiness and a little belgian spice. Taste is fresh tropical fruit for days, lingering around your tastebuds for quite a while, wonderful. Low carbonation, soft medium- body but slightly watery. Low bittering/drying. Probably the best pale I've ever had, both bursting with flavor and deeply refreshing. Could CRUSH a 4 pack of these in a heartbeat.","Aug 03, 2019"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,Massachusetts,4.75/5,"Nose is pineapples, candied tangerine, pine. Taste follows with pithy tangerine with some pineapple and then finishes like biting into a juicy tangerine. If you let it linger more there is creamy mango and melon left. The feel is pillowy with solid carb. Overall a really pleasant pale ale.","Jul 07, 2019"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,,Indiana,4.27/5,"On draft in canton. 

Completely hazy, light, pineapple juice color. 
The nose brings sharp, sweet citrus. 
Taste comes in with tropical/citrus notes and a nice bitter background. 

Bitterness in there while still keeping it on the soft side.","Jul 05, 2019"
Cable Car Kriek,,Massachusetts,3.16/5,"2021 vintage. Ruby red body with surprisingly little carbonation and no head whatsoever. Aromas are pretty standard kriek: cherry pie, lemon, hay, bit of vinegar. Very little funk, which is a bit unusual. Flavors are acetic but also semi-sweet, with predominant notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Feel is slippery and a bit flat due to the low carbonation. Overall I think this is one of those beers that made waves upon release when the idea of Belgian lambics was still relatively unknown in the US, but now that we have broader access to some of the best Belgium offerings here in the states it doesn't quite hold up. Especially given the price point ($90/750ml), I would not buy this again but happy to have the opportunity.

Cable Car Kriek,,Colorado,4.33/5,2021,"Aug 18, 2023"
Cable Car Kriek,,Alabama,4.28/5,"2021 Vintage.

Gorgeous ruby red pour; very few agitated bubbles of carbonation as it’s poured into the glass. It settles flat.

The nose is still distinctly Cable Car, with noticeable yet restrained funk and lemony citrus. The cherry adds more brightness and is a fresh, fruity addition. With time, a lot of oak and Brett comes to the forefront.

The palate is sour and noticeably acidic, with a surprisingly low carbonation. Was definitely hoping for more of it to cut that tart cherry and acid, but overall it’s never overwhelming. The tannin from the cherry works really well with the overall profile. 

As stated above, not sure if that much carb was lost since 2021 or it was just never very high, but I felt it needed more. That said, it drinks bright and refreshing, with restrained tannin.","Feb 20, 2023"

Cable Car Kriek,,Wisconsin,5/5,This is for the 375mL release in February of 2022 from OG kegs the brewery found. This beer was nothing short of amazing!

Cable Car Kriek,,Massachusetts,4.1/5,"Batch 2. Was light, little acid on it, did not have the regular mouth feel of regular Cable Car. Smooth in beginning, nice red color to it. Body was on thinner side","Dec 18, 2021"
Cable Car Kriek,,California,4.77/5,Look of murky ruby red. Small amount of head forms at the top. Smell is of vinous cherry. Smells excellent still. Taste is light acidity and funk with full blown cherry. The feel is light and perfect amount of carbonation. Even after all these years it still has a lot of cherry. Hands down one of the best sours I have ever had the opportunity to drink. Would hunt it down again for sure.,"May 13, 2016"
Cable Car Kriek,,France,4.86/5,"Had this side by side with 2013 regular Cable Car and Veritas 012.
A: Be warned, this is a gusher! We were aware of it so we opened it carefully enough to lose very few of it. Pours darker than Veritas 012, reddish with a good white foam.
S: Smell is really complex, although the cherry is not obvious. The balance is awesome. Barnyard, funk, verry clean. Tart cherries come after with raspberries and minerals aromas. Reminiscent of the old 3F Hommage for some reason.
T: Taste is more focused on the red fruits and some soaked fruits. Still very clean for an American wild ale. Lots of funk, barnyard, horse blanket, hay. Sharp sourness, no acidic acid, no lactiness. Highly drinkable.
M: Well carbonated, soft mouthfeel, puckering sourness, awesome!
O: Mindblowing beer. Very very surprising. It brings Cable Car to another level and completely overwhelms the Veritas 012. I am glad I was able to try this, it certainly lives up to the hype.","Nov 07, 2015"
Cable Car Kriek,,Pennsylvania,5/5,Might be the best beer I've ever had!,"Apr 09, 2015"
Cable Car Kriek,,Florida,4.17/5,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. 

Appearance - Hazy and murky red body. Did not gush! Small white head. Medium collar.

Smell - Juicy cherry. Acidic, but the cherry has a sweet pie aroma. Characteristic Lost Abbey sour aroma. Not quite acetic, but intense and woody.

Taste - Cherry is just like the aroma, hints of cherry pie but not that sweet. Woody. Has some vinegar sourness to it. 

Mouthfeel - High carbonation. Moderate sourness, not so intense, especially for a Lost Abbey beer.

Overall - This still doesn't compare to the complexity of a lambic, but it's very good. Nowhere near worth what it takes to get, though.","May 18, 2014"
Cable Car Kriek,,South Africa,4.61/5,"750ml bottle 7,0% Abv. 
Served chilled in a wine glass. 
No bottle date. 

CCK was one of those beers that wasn't even on my want list as I was pretty sure I would never ever get a chance to taste, but thanks to the endless generosity of futur123 I am actually about to taste it! Thanks man, I really owe you for this one. 

Appearance: The cork popped out with an almighty bang and for a moment I thought I would get away without a gush, but as soon as I took my eye off the bottle pink foam started to rise slowly out of the neck. Thankfully I had glasses ready and managed to catch it all. 
The beer settles a clouded red-orange (almost peachy) with just a tinge of pink and is topped by a large pink tinted head. The head retention is reasonable, but sadly it doesn't leave anything in the way of lacing. 

Smell: Wow, there is a ton of cherry in the initial nose and far sweeter than I had expected - its almost jammy. A few more sniffs reveal a fantastic acidity (a touch of vinegar) as well as a spicy almost cinnamon bark character. As the beer warms the nose opens up with a little oak and some funk (old hay, wet wood, mold and the faintest hint of vomit) becoming apparent. 

Taste: As the nose suggested there is a ton of sweet cherry upfront, but it is balanced by a nice tartness and a fantastic acidity. Notes include: Sweet jammy cherries, some tart cherry skins, a touch of vinegar, a little oak, lightly spicy, undergrowth, old hay and a touch of leather. The finish is quite dry. 

Mouthfeel: Initially there is a high level of rather expansive carbonation, but thankfully it settles down pretty quickly to reveal finer bubbles that complement the acidity perfectly and lead to a fantastically spritzy finish. The body is medium and offers the faintest stickiness from the fruit. 

Overall: Cable Car Kriek is a fantastic cherry sour and quite a lot better than the regular Cable Car. That said, I would be really pissed off if I had paid $750 or what ever ridiculous price this are being sold for these days.","Jan 14, 2014"
Cable Car Kriek,,Illinois,5/5,"Reviewing a bottle of the test batch for Cable Car Kriek from The Lost Abbey out of San Marcos, California. Major thanks to Paul and Jonathan for sharing this rare treat with me!

Score: 100

The only thing I know about the bottling date of this beer is that it predates the 2011 release of Cable Car Kriek. My buddy got a Cable Car Kriek label sticker, which he put on the otherwise unmarked bottle. Served in a Cantillon stemmed balloon glass and enjoyed on 11/16/13. Review is from iPhone notes.

Appearance: Pours a finger-plus of white frothy head. Color is a murky red-orange color with a bit of yellow-orange fade towards the edges of the body when held up to light. Excellent lacing and retention. 5/5

Smell: Cherry, then dank cinnamon, funk, wood, dank spice, fig, raisin, wood and lemon. Hint of tobacco and vanilla. Lots of unexpected cinnamon present in the nose, which is ridiculously complex and perfectly balanced between all the elements present. Just enough funk is present to give it an added dimension of complexity without detracting at all from the appeal of the other aromatics. 5/5

Taste: Tart cherry hits first, then cinnamon, spice, vanilla and wood. Musty funk on the midpalate, oddly reminisce of that Cantillon house character with a little bit of age. Vanilla and cherrywood finish, light lemon backbone. Dark cherry notes and a little bit of cocoa-like flavor come through too as the beer warms up. The cherry flavor persists throughout, and lingers nicely in the finish. I love how well the vanilla flavor plays with sour characters without being medicinal or coming across as being out of place. All the flavors here are so perfectly integrated. There is so much going on, and it all works. The cinnamon character is a nice unique twist, though it is less prominent on the palate than it was in the nose. 5/5

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, spot on carbonation (rare for a Lost Abbey beer). Great mix of sweet and sour, with a dry finish. 5/5

Overall: One of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure to consume. It is complex, robust in flavor, tart, balanced and insanely drinkable. There is a reason this is one of the most sought after beers out there. I would not say it is worth the $600-800 it commands on the secondary market, but I enjoyed it more than M, which costs much more to acquire. My only quip here is that someone stole the bottle from Paul later in the evening. Seek this one out with confidence.

Cost: $50 for a 750 ml bottle (good luck finding it that for that price nowadays).","Dec 18, 2013"
Cable Car Kriek,,California,4.32/5,"Bottle pour at Woodshop 8 held at The Hermosillo in Los Angeles, CA.

Pours a murky reddish-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, cherry, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet and sour cherry flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic balance of sweet and sour cherry flavors that make this one a real treat to drink.","Oct 28, 2013"
Cable Car Kriek,,New York,4.54/5,"Big thanks to Josh(jbuddle) for opening this.

A- reddish pink with a beautiful haze and a soft pillow of white, cloud like head.

N- sour cherry, oak, funky sourness

T- a depth of cherry flavor, both sweet and sour cherry. great oakiness is coming through from sip to finish. sour fruit with a suttle sweetness. mmm this is good.

M- light spritzy carbonation, smooth dry finish

O- this one gets best in style IMO. by far the best kriek i have had.","Apr 25, 2013"
Cable Car Kriek,,New York,4.43/5,"Thanks to Mike and Josh for this one. A long time want and one I thought I'd have to eventually travel to CA for. Much appreciated. 4oz. pour into a Lost Abbey teku. 

Pours a .5 finger pink, frothy head with average retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy stunning pink orange. Lacing is spotty and sparse with some stringiness and thin legs. Average save for the really pretty color. 

Nose is cinnamon, cherry jam, light tartness, hay, and some funky, wed woodiness. Clean, fruity and very aromatic and appetizing. 

Sweet cherry, cinnamon, red fruit syrup, lightly sweet and mildly tart in the middle. Great balance. More cherry, lemon rind, and hay at the finish with a sweet and tart cherry aftertaste. Really really good. 

Light to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Dry in the mouth and puckering going down. Very refreshing. Sticky and dry finish with a messy and lingering aftertaste. Nearly perfect. 

I thought Cable Car was a slightly above average American Wild but this is a completely different animal. The addition of cherries has given this beer a whole new dimension and makes it clearly one of the best in the style. Definitely worth the hype.","Jan 13, 2013"
Cable Car Kriek,,Colorado,4.42/5,"Brown glass bottle served into a wine glass at the Toronado in San Diego. Paid out the ass for this (I think it around $50.00). If there's a beer to shell this much out for, certainly this is it. (Or at least one of them; see my Narke Kaggen Stormaktsporter review). Reviewed from notes taken in October 2012. 

A: Pours a half finger delicate beige head of good lacing, nice thickness, and brief but appreciable retention. Colour is a pale peach-red. Nontransparent; non-opaque. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Has the appeal of a masterful red wine or bourbon. Classy and understated. I can't wait to try it.

Sm: Sourness, bacteria, attenuated yeast, sour cherry, lactic notes, some malty sweetness, tart cherry skin, and bright fruit. Exceptional and clean. Promises some serious puckerworthy sourness. A moderate strength aroma. No alcohol comes through.

T: Sour, with some serious bacterial notes on the back end. Incredibly crisp like fresh red apple yet outfitted with a wonderful solid cherry body. Refreshing and clean, yet lightly vinegary and even subtly wine-esque. I get the wood, but it's subtle and understated in the background. Rich and smcak-your-lips flavorful. Incredibly tasty stuff. Masterfully complex and balanced. No alcohol is detectable. So fresh and luscious. The lingering long aftertaste helps me enjoy it for longer. I get cherrywood as well as oak. Some pear. Green apple. It's got all the sourness I could ever want, but the perfect amount without feeling tamed. Not at all overdone. Clean malts lend it body but don't intrude, letting the sourness shine through. It has an incredible amount of body for a kriek, almost like a fine French cider. I'm blown away. Marvelously built. Nicely acidic, as well. Tartness is supreme. 

Mf: Crisp, full, and of perfect thickness. Smack-your-lips delightful. Smooth and wet, letting the flavour speak for itself. Suits the flavour profile quite well. 

Dr: An incredible kriek. Lives up to the hype, definitely. Worth the price for a special occasion. Another remarkable sour from Lost Abbey. I'd love to have this again (or the regular Cable Car, for that matter). The mouthfeel isn't perfect; it lacks the fragile delicacy I'd expect in a masterful sour - but it's still lovely. Few sours I've had have such presence and flavour. The depth of flavour and layers of mastery burgeon throughout. I detect at least five distinct acts in the structure: the sweet, clean open; the initial sour apple and hints of bacteria; the middling bacteria sourness blast; the fading cidery sharp climax with hints of lightly spicy yeast and cherry abound; and the lightly dry fruit cherry skin finnish. Remarkable. Wow.

Cable Car Kriek,,Pennsylvania,4/5,"Had on tap at Toronado for the 25th Anniversary Party. Pour is hazy grapefruit red with white head an pink hue. Nose is light acetic, sour cherry, hints of lacto, and faint cheese with light sawdust. Taste is brighter, cherry is decent but a bit pitty, nice cherry juice quality and fairly sour without being acetic. A touch dry with lighter carb and a prickly finish. Lacks funk of traditional lambic but not bad.","Oct 09, 2012"
Cable Car Kriek,,California,4.67/5,"SO EXCITED to try this beer. I walked into SD Toronado (the SUPERIOR Toronado of the two) while I was on my birthday vacation and was shocked to see this sitting in the cooler. Yes, it was SITTING IN THE COOLER...for all to see. No asking the bartenders if they have it just to let them decide if they like you enough to serve it to you. This Toronado does it how it should be. Such great service, outstanding food, and great beer selection. Back to the Kriek,..it poured a lot less ""pink"" than I thought it would be. It was a clouded, light-red color with an off-white head. Scent is very cherry-forward with some definite barnyard and musty aromas. The smell is so darn inviting, I can't help but take few sips of this beer immediately. The cherry is so profound in this beer, more than I expected. A good amount of oak and funk. Not overly acidic whatsoever...in fact, not very acidic at all. Just a clean, funky, fruity, wild ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost puckering, with a juicy finish. Sour and juicy equals amazing in my book. Drinkability is VERY HIGH. Overall, this beer was worth every penny I spent on it. I went into the night willing to spend $80 on the bottle, just to find out it was $55. So worth it. A phenomenal wild ale.","Oct 03, 2012"
Cable Car Kriek,,California,4.09/5,"On tap at the Toronado anniversary party. Pours a reddish murky amber with no head and no lacing left on the glass. The aroma is big cherry. There is also quite a bit of funky oak and a bit of raspberry. Quite musty. The initial taste is sweet with big cherry. There is also a bit of musty oak and some raspberry.

Cable Car Kriek,,District of Columbia,4.42/5,"Shared by ygtbsm94 at the Sour & Wild Ale Tasting on April 14, 2012. Thanks a lot Brad.

Served side by side with an unlabeled bottle of Cable Car Kriek, apparently more tart than the labeled / distributed version.

Served in my Lost Abbey teku glass. 

After the beer gushed everywhere, it appears a beautiful ruby hue with a soft, pink head. Bonus points for the pretty appearance, deductions for the carbonation issues so commonly associated with The Lost Abbey.

Beautiful aroma. Tart cherries and distinctive Lost Abbey funk. 

Not especially tart, but a delicate balance of sweet cherry and tart, funky wild ale. Again, very well done.

Light on the palate. Moderate carbonation on the tongue.

Overall, this was quite good. Aside from the gushing, I have no complaints. I'm grateful for the opportunity to try this rare delicacy, not to mention two versions side by side!","Aug 09, 2012"
Cable Car Kriek,,California,4.3/5,"Thanks, Shane!

Pours a hazy red color with an off-white head. Excellent cherry aroma to go with the lactic acidity from the base beer. Mild straw and oak, a bit of grass, too. Cherry flavor is very well pronounced. Nice and dry with lemon, lemon zest, and a pleasant tartness. There is a little bit of oak and a mild acetic note on the finish.","Aug 07, 2012"
Cable Car Kriek,,Maryland,3.85/5,"A bit thanks to Tomme and crew for bringing this along to our tasting. Poured from the bottle into a tasting snifter. No gushing due to Tomme's expert bottle opening skills.

Appearance: The beer pours a very cloudy red and golden color. The color is a bit weird to be honest.

Smell: Some nice fruity cherry notes right off the bat. There is some sour notes as well, just a touch medicinal.

Taste: Sweet and tart cherries. Sour, but not overly so. There is a good amount of sweetness to balance out the sour flavors. The finish is slightly bitter with a mild herbal note.

Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a dry finish.

Overall: This was yet another good sour from Lost Abbey. I enjoyed the fruit notes. The fact that it wasn't too sour was a nice break for the tongue. I wouldn't search this one out again given the difficulty.","Jul 13, 2012"
Cable Car Kriek,,Oregon,4.22/5,"Thank you, Tomme.

Cherry red with a thin, white head, this looks nice. The nose has a big red cherry character, ripe, fruity and sweet. The base sour has a nice lemony aroma. Moderately chalky and mineraly, this smells bright and refreshing.
The palate is sour with ripe and sweet cherries. Chalky, yeasty and frothy, but the cherries! fantastic! Sweet, mildly syrupy even, with a sweet and tart flavor blend, this is simple but nicely done. Drying on the finish with ripe and sweet cherries, this is mildly spicy as well. Moderately carbonated, this beer feels quite nice on the palate. A touch of grape flavor is present as well Simple but very enjoyable.","Jul 02, 2012"
Cable Car Kriek,,District of Columbia,4.15/5,"Thanks to Tomme for bringing this to the Lost Abbey tasting. 

Beer pours a hazy pink lemonade color with medium white head. Smell is a fantastic cherry aroma with a nice amount of sour and more funk than I expected. After the intensity of the early Veritas beers, this one is considerably more tame. It's still sour, but it's very restrained with a great sweeter cherry flavor - more like a cherry pie than a big sour cherry. Nothing about this beer particularly stands out, but it's still quite good. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this beer is a great tasty cherry beer, but after all of the crazy beers we've just had, it doesn't quite stand up to them.","Jul 01, 2012"
Swish,,North Carolina,4.65/5,"Pale, opaque orange with thin tan head. Standard hazy look. Smell is complex with pithy rind, orange, vanilla, and malts.

Swish,,Massachusetts,4.59/5,"Bissell Brothers is the Larry Bird/Magic Johnson of breweries to me. Not a knock at all, but my MJ is the Alchemist. That being said, the Swish drops in to my stomach like a Steph Curry logo 3 point shot. Nothing but net, all swish. Beautiful Laker gold color. Completely opaque with a slight bubbly froth. On the nose you get Phoenix Suns orange with some Miami Heat tropical pineapple notes. Was expecting a thick Shaq like body but it’s a more lean medium body, reminiscent of a Dwight Howard. Taste wise you get the traditional IPA bitter hop bite that gives a slight Celtics green herby taste. However it also has that new wave NEIPA melon, cream, citrus fruit flavor. The NEIPA is the new dynasty, the Golden State Warriors of the beer industry. What an absolute treat, go Nuggets.","Jun 09, 2023"
Swish,,New Jersey,4.62/5,"(16 oz can, 011073 04-17-23; purchased cold 4-pk at the brewery 2 days ago... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: impenetrably-hazy, pale yellow-amber liquid with mildly golden highlights on the fringes... moderately tall foam rise on the pour, sinking back into a misty cap... bit of a letdown from the lame head retention and little lacing

S: lime hull, lemon peel, mango funk, grapefruit pith; slight capsicum spicy accent... cream of wheat... vibrant greenness cutting through the perfumy fruits... the booze does boost the contact and seduction

T: much more malt and mush than I'd anticipated, and it's great!; floral rush halfway, morphing into a tropical cleaver into the finish, during which a powdery grain flour note swells up and hangs up front long into the aftertaste... almost halfway through and wow! did the tropical hopping burst back onto my palate, fresh and enlivening... masterpiece of balance for its ilk

F: only a faint sense of alcohol at the back of the palate; the milky grains and silky hop resins team to tame the heat I suppose... I wouldn't go any higher with the abv for this style; 7.5% is usually my sweet spot, and this is just tickling the tonsils, just inching toward unnecessary noxious-ity

O: not a fan of hazies, but this shot right up into my top 3 or 4; they really do have a good thing going as I've very much enjoyed the unique character of each brand I've tried from them... I could definitely see getting this again (good excuse for another beer run to Maine); it has a lot going on for the style; some depth and dimension to the gritty grain bill; too smooth and moreish (2122)","Apr 24, 2023"

Feel is a touch light, but that adds to the drinkability without being too heavy. Nice effervescence.

Taste follows the smell, forward and strong grapefruit dominates, undertones of citrus, lemon, orange. Very delicious, very drinkable. Nicely balanced without being a ‘juice bomb’ or cloyingly dank.

Lovely three finger head forms on the beer, lingers, and then dissipates leaving a thin layer of residual foam on top of the beer. Aroma has notes of bright citrus, papaya, pineapple, with some light dank hoppy notes. Its really nice - balance of sweetness, fruit but with some bitterness. 

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange rind, mango, papaya and peach - sweet but not overly so. A nice bitterness on the back end cuts that sweetness down and balances it out a bit. There are some light straw notes and a certain grassiness to the beer. Feel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, somewhat drier finish. 

Overall its a lovely NE style IPA and definitely worthy of the high ranking here. Its not often these days that a NE style IPA impresses me, but this one did.","Mar 07, 2021"
Swish,,New Hampshire,3.97/5,"Can from Jeff, thanks for the trade. 
Thought I'd rated this guess not. Hazy dark lemon color with a decent sized long lasting bubbly white head. Pithy resinous aroma with sweet bread. Fruity pineapple and grapefruit with plenty of earthy pine and resin. Nice Brew.","Jan 26, 2021"

Look: Nice haze, typical with this style

Overall: An excellent brew all around. Lives up to the hype. An instant classic!","Jan 21, 2021"
Swish,,Maine,4.86/5,"This was canned 3 days ago!!!!

Appearance: Looks like a hazy IPA, nothing special in this department. Yellow haze, thin head, small bubbles

Smell: In a word, awesome, notes in order of most to least: big citrus rind, big dank, big malt sweet, some pineapple, some melon

Taste: Even better than aroma. Balanced just the way I like, primarily hop forward but a solid malt backbone. Sweet malt presence but way less than you would expect from aroma. Big citrus, big tropical, big dank, solid sweet malt, solid bitter, light bready malt, light pine/resin, no booze, finishes dry

Feel: Medium body, creamy, dry finish, not astringent

Overall: Outside of appearance this is among the best DIPA's I have ever had. While the flavor profile is common, this is just better executed than most. It balances the flavors in a way that suits my preference while having a world class aroma and feel. It is also worth pointing out how fresh the beer is, which certainly plays a role here.","Jan 16, 2021"

Swish,,Indiana,4.5/5,"Appearance - The beer poured with the appearance of orange juice with no pulp and a bubbly white head. 

Smell - The nose was composed of orange juice the leaned more bitter than the average hazy. 

Taste - Orange rind led the way, which kept the beer from being overly sweet. A spiciness followed that caused a light warming sensation. The overall profile had a nice sense of balance. It was sweet, but not loaded with added junk. 

Mouthfeel - The haziness paralleled a thick body. It was not quite drinking juice without pulp, but it was thick. 

Overall - This is a great example of the style that is not overdone.","Nov 13, 2020"
Swish,,Massachusetts,4.05/5,"I had a draft of this at the brewery in Portland, ME. I have to admit, I wasn't impressed. It tasted mildly soapy to me. The IPA present notes of pine and citrus and some mango were there for me but I just couldn't get rid of the soapy note and it felt unbalanced to me.

The colour and smell were fine ... the mouthfeel was indistinguishable to just about any other IPA I've had but there was just nothing overly special about this beer. I'd rate it way below Sip of Sunshine or Very Green by Treehouse. Its clear this has some of the same notes as a Treehouse IPA but overall it just doesn't feel as balanced. It's like hearing a HS Symphony band vs. The Boston Pops. I'd rate this slightly under a King Sue or Greater Good.

Overall, I just wasn't a fan. As they say in the Bronx, it's just 'A'iiiight'.","Nov 13, 2020"

The Broken Truck,,Massachusetts,4.47/5,"Pours golden with frothy soap off white head. Mustyness and wash rind cheese with a touch of apple flesh on the nose. The first thing that stands out is that this is soft - it doesn't have any commandeering characteristics that detract from the others. I get some apple, some arugula bitterness, with restrained acidity. Maybe some musty sour cherry too, kinda like what you get in a kriek but very much more subtle. This is an excellent excellent spon beer. One of the best beers of this variety I've had in some time.","Jul 09, 2023"
The Broken Truck,,Nevada,4.63/5,"Man if I had to put potentially the best beers of 2022 against each other, it might be this and that Gueuze from New Glarus. Whooo boy, some good'uns. This is the '22 bottle.

Pours yellow out on the river. Summer winding down, let's finish it up. Hits some amazing funky sour spontaneous notes. And they said it couldn't be done on this side of the pond. Just a delight to smell. The best of what Tilamook has to offer. Boasts fresh french oak feels, bugs, grapefruit, lemon rind, bleu cheese, green apple yogurt. The gang's all here.

The taste was such a nice thing, great bottle on one of those awesome yet sad close to summer beers. Made it memorable. Its vibrant, fresh cut hay and oak alongside some citrus wedges like you just stomped some kids at youth soccer. One of the best expressions of brett ever in a beer. Sawft body too, never felt too acidic or sour. This is honestly better than most Belgian gueuzes. I realize given the demographics of beer nerds, they're going to keep fetishizing Western Europe, but I'll be more than happy to take any of these Wisconsin and Oregon gems off your hands.","Mar 13, 2023"
The Broken Truck,,Alabama,4.29/5,"Opened up No. 6 (1/20), 7 (1/21), and 8 (1/22) together and tasted side-by-side.

All three boasted a beautiful golden yellow on the pour, with frothy, aromatic head that was slow to settle into the body of the beer.

No.6 brought notes of lemon zest, oak, and white grape must on a sweet, musty backbone. No. 7 came on sweeter, with more of a citrus candy quality and a bit less Brett character. The oak component had more of a ""freshly cut"" aroma to it, and preceded notes of bleu cheese that I didn't get on No.6. No.8 was probably the most distinctly unique; white wine like with 7, but more of a grapefruit-specific citrus quality and a deeper complexity of wet hay and an overall better balance of sweet & funky.

The palate on all three of these were led predominantly with drying tannin and bitter citrus peel. The oakiness was relatively similar amongst the three and bolstered the flavor influence from the yeast bill, however while No.8 showed its youth with the least amount of bitterness, 7 & 8 had comparable dryness and a more noticeable citrusy bitterness. No. 6 was also had the highest level of residual puckering tartness.

Light-bodied, dry, and lightly bitter mouthfeel to all three. As mentioned, varying levels of tartness / acid, but all very soft in their carbonation and smooth in the finish.

Overall, I'm honestly surprised with how similar each vintage of these beers was. Each had their own unique nuances, but when broken down you could find very similar characteristics on both the nose and the palate with both, characterizing a predominance of fresh oak, Brett, bitter citrus, drying tannin, and a noticeable albeit subtle funky/cheesy quality on the backbone. Definitely fun to have these all side-by-side.","Nov 06, 2022"
The Broken Truck,,Vermont,4.5/5,"OG batch 1 Broken Truck. 
Classic de Garde taste, similar in quality to all of the ""Bu"" beers that were bottled during the brewery's infancy. 
It lacks the nuance of Trevor's newer offerings; minimal funk, lesser barrel treatment, aggressively sour. 
Overall, a legendary beer whose story was greater than its contents.","Oct 31, 2022"
The Broken Truck,,Indiana,4.56/5,"Appearance - The beer, from a double sealed bottle, poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head. 

Smell - The brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness. 

Taste - Grass, green apples, and a brett character that really stands out. The finish had a bitter earthy quality. It was not particularly sour, but it definitely brought the funk. 

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive, quickly sweeping away any sweetness. 

Overall - No fruits or adjuncts are needed. This was great.","Mar 12, 2022"

The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Its actually not harsh on the palate, quite easy to drink. 

Overall: its a great beer. Not as complex as I expected, but its simplicity is not a bad thing. Its quite similar to to FFG Last Four Winters in Wisconsin and New Glarus Vintage series. It would be fun to have them all side by side.","Apr 25, 2021"

Nose: 4 - smells just like The Lily. White wine. EXTREMELY funky.

Taste: 4 - weird, it's actually kind of bitter. It's very sout, but it's got this vinegary quality to it. Good, but not amazing. Like a fine gueuze.

The Broken Truck,,California,4.54/5,"Really awesome and complex offering from De Garde. As a member, this beer is one of the ones I most look forward to each and every year. Absolutely worth seeking out.","Jan 04, 2021"
The Broken Truck,,Oregon,4.56/5,"Bottle, blend 3, purchased at The Tin Bucket.

A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present.

The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like.

The Broken Truck,,Massachusetts,4.35/5,"Batch 5, bottled January, 2019, drank over two nights in September, 2019 first from a Hill Farmstead stemmed wineglass, then from a Tree House Teku.

A beautiful looking beer that hit all the right notes from the look, feel and smell departments, same as others have described. The taste, again, hitting on those same descriptions, was good, but for me it ended up being just too acidic; I even had to ditch the last couple ounces as my stomach had had enough. Usually I'm ok with excessively wild wilds, etc. but the acidity for this version of BT (only one I've tried), was off the charts for me - it didn't actually taste ""overly"" acidic; the taste was really pretty good, it was more the effect that the acidic component had on my stomach. I have read this in a couple other reviews so not sure if this is typical of all BTs, or if it was more isolated to this batch. Or maybe some more time in the bottle would have helped? Either way, it was a bit of a disappointment, especially for a beer that I had waited so long to try and so eagerly anticipated.","Sep 02, 2019"
The Broken Truck,,New York,4.65/5,"This one pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like white wine, sour candy, peach, citrus, oak, and a deep dirty funk.

This has the complexity of actual Belgian lambic for sure, but maybe a bit more brash and aggressive than the most traditional takes. There's lots of white wine and white fruit flavors (white peach, white grape, etc). There's also bit of citrus rind and pepper, and definitely some spicy oak. This is so wonderfully delicious.

This is light bodied, clean, and very drinkable, with not a ton of lingering acidity.

This is definitely one of the best beers that de Garde has done - it's mighty good.","Aug 08, 2019"
The Broken Truck,,Colorado,4.46/5,"for how hyped up this particular one is, it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far, and frankly nowhere near the objective best, if thats not nitpicking at this point (all of them being so fantastic). i love the story of this, but from the bottle, it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have, especially some of the fruited ones. its really sour, more acidic than i remember most of them being, and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure, even with the amazing carbonation, soft round mouthfeel, and relative dryness to finish, its still just a slow sipper for me, which is probably how lambic should be anyway, but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly, and thats over the line for my preferences. perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long, being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it, but not all of these age favorably apparently. the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic, musty bretty and funky, with distinct juicy fruitiness to it, white wine, apricots, even ripe pears, its rustic and interesting, but with the acid its pretty aggressive. the oak is sturdy here too, grounding and dense all the way through which i really like, it seems sort of oddly hoppy, like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid, and if they did, there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow. its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style. despite the developed brett and heavy wood, this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend, less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring, and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character, this is almost too refined to fit that bill, not a criticism just a commentary. i think id like it more if the sourness were less, and dont get me wrong i still love it, but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers. always a treat to have their stuff though, and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now...

edit: this was leagues better the second time around for me, less acidity, a lot more nuance to the wild yeast profile, and with a fresh hoppy character to it at the end, tons of white wine, elderflower, and even white peach, its goegeous, and was a standout from a heavy session of amazing beers. not sure why it didnt taste like this the first time around, but i hve a raise a few scores to reflect how good it was this time. huge thanks to my buddy for sharing his bottle!","Jan 18, 2019"
The Broken Truck,,Virginia,4.39/5,"Batch 4. Bottled 1/18.

A: Pours a pale golden, somewhat hazy, with two fingers of white foamy head. Very good retention and some dots and streaks of lacing. Champagne-like effervescence. 

S: Musty and dusty (in a good way) like a wine cellar, moderate amount of earthy funk, and light apple and graininess. A very appealing and elegant expression of Brett.

T: Upfront, light apple, tartness, sweet graininess, and earthy barnyard upfront; followed by light earthy funk, apple, and some sweet maltiness. Almost no sourness.

M: Medium body, medium and fizzy carbonation. 

O: Amazing, Bretty nose. The taste is a bit subdued but still enjoyable.","Jan 15, 2019"

The beer pours a light gold, mostly transparently, with a hugely funky nose. It's fairly sour and funky, with a medium mouth feel, and a bit of tartness. Slightly acetic, though my stomach had been suffering all evening long from sours. The finish does not linger, so it's fairly pleasantly clean.

The Broken Truck,,Ohio,4.12/5,"Hazy pineapple juice yellow with a large fuzzy white froth that dies quickly to a lightly spotty film.

Smell is pungent, sweaty apricot, aged hops, grapefruit and weed.

Taste is smoother than the nose suggests, but still pungent of peach and grapefruit, sort of like the 2013 Vigneronne we just had before it. Actually this is better, but the Vig seemed a bit off, as though it hadn't aged well. This BT also has a touch of lemon rind. As it warms, and you get closer to the sediment, the oaky funky actually becomes a bit cedary--very unique!

Effervescent froth runs through the prickly, wildly complex and tart medium body with a semi-dry finish.

It is rich smelling with so much chocolate and coffee that they battle for attention. 

Tastes like it smells but a tad bit sweeter, with dark chocolate, fresh brewed black coffee, espresso, cocoa powder, ground coffee, bakers chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, milk chocolate, vanilla, a chocolate ice cream shake with hot fudge and Hershey's chocolate syrup, roasted nuts and chocolate milk. This is more chocolate than coffee in the flavor, which is the opposite of the aroma.

Pours completely pitch black with a thick finger of dark espresso colored head that slowly fades to and ring and leaves great lacing, especially for the abv and style

This beer has an aroma that toes the line between decadently sweet and firmly roasted. I'm picking up on aromas of nutty espresso, milk chocolate fudge, creamy vanilla, medium roast coffee, and a touch of dark fruit, mostly raisin

Following suit taste-wise, this starts off very sweet, but leaves long contemplative aftertastes that suggest an aggressive yet classic stout. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting rich milk chocolate, creamy coffee, deep black cherry, and caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweetened espresso, raisin, dark chocolate, dark toast, and chewy caramel

A full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a creamy and chewy beer that needs some time to go down. Finishes mostly dry surprisingly with waves of sweet and roasty weaving in and out

Another winner from TH. A bit heavy at times, especially up front, but once you get past that it's smooth sailing. I'd get it again along with some of the variants","Apr 03, 2021"

Massive dose of coffee on the nose - one of the most potent coffee-forward brews I have ever found. Along with waves of roast coffee, dark stout tones of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toast, toffee, and chocolate round out the profile.

On the palate, the stout base initially asserts itself, although the huge coffee influence isn't far behind. It's a very fruity, berry-forward coffee profile. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, cream, blueberries, toast, light char, cherries, bark.

Triple Shot,,New York,4.4/5,"On a sad note, this is my last Treehouse brew left in the fridge. I nursed this bomber all by myself.

From the bottle, it pours a viscous and motor oil looking dark liquid. The color is nearly pitch black. Surprisingly, a finger length tan mocha head belatedly billows up to the surface. It shows decent retention and rings of lacing.

As the name would suggest the nose is dominated by notes of coffee and espresso. In addition, there are notes of dark chocolate, toasted and nutty malts, caramel, brown sugar and dark fruit. The hops aromas have a subtle earthy and woodsy quality to them.

Full bodied with a smooth and mouth coating viscous feel. The carbonation is gentle and mellow. The flavors are rich and complex yet not too cloyingly sweet or boozy. Decadent flavors of milk chocolate fudge, caramel and brown sugar are balanced by bittersweet notes of dark chocolate and roasted malts. There are jammy flavors of dark fruit and bright notes of cherry. Surprisingly, the coffee flavor is not as prominent as in the aroma, although it is felt more in the finish. The bitterness is relatively tame as it is provided by gentle notes of woodsy hops and light notes of espresso. The finish is long and creamy with moderately toasty notes. 

This is a nice dessert beer that really hit the spot. I would have liked a bit more coffee flavor, however, my sense of taste might have been a little off tonight. It’s also very drinkable despite the ABV.","Mar 09, 2020"
Triple Shot,,Minnesota,4.5/5,Poured from a bottle on 12-5-19. Coffee is more prevalent in the aroma while mocha is more up front in taste. This is above average in thickness and quite tasty.,"Mar 09, 2020"
Triple Shot,,Pennsylvania,4.43/5,"Look - Poured into a teku, thicker than your average stout. Nice tan head with bubbles of varying thickness.

Smell - Coffee aroma with underlying chocolate notes, roasty malt goodness. Not very boozy on the nose.

Taste - This beer had the perfect balance of coffee and stout. There was some sweetness without being cloying. The chocolate notes were rich but lingered in the background. Very little alcohol taste perceptible to me.

Feel - It felt very nice on the palate. The thickness gave it a velvety mouthfeel, but it didn't coat my mouth in the way that some stouts can.

Overall - Great stout with big yet balanced flavor. Very drinkable for it's abv. I could make this my go-to coffee stout if I had regular access to it. Highly enjoyable.","Mar 08, 2020"
Triple Shot,,Delaware,4.13/5,"Super yummy. Once it warms and opens up, the coffee overwhelms the palate and the nose. Not a bad thing at all, yummy","Mar 07, 2020"
Triple Shot,,Germany,4.37/5,"Pours pitch black in color with a big, spongy mohagony colored head.

Smell is of chocolate covered coffee beans, together with a lighter roast and licorice quality to it. Packs a decadent bitter chocolate smack among accentuating caramel and a note of charred coals.

This has an incredibly smooth and silk mouthfeel, featuring a decadent, fuller body. Each sip drinks utmost creamy and soft, with a long lasting burst of flavors.

Tastes of sugar glazed coffee beans, lending milk chocolate and a rustic dryness to roasty, spicy malts. Offers a phenomenal creaminess then with bitter chocolate and licorice, balanced by a fair amount of toastiness. Develops a late, well working, espresso rock sugar peak, which hid underneath the licorice for the longest time, blending well into the chocolate, covered by a late, dry bean appearance.

This is quite the coffee stout. While this ranges definitely a little more on the sweeter side, it packs a great amount of roast, whipped cream and dry coffee, establishing a fantastic balance and depth.","Feb 23, 2020"
Focal Banger,,Louisiana,4.75/5,"Heady Topper has a thick, off-white head and a mostly-clear, golden appearance, with lots of suspended sediment, throughout.

Focal Banger,,Pennsylvania,4.55/5,"Enjoying on the front porch, gorgeous, cool August day, the 18th, 2023. (Canned on 8/15/23!)

So excited to find this treasure at our Washington beer store.

Gorgeous straw/light golden color, slightly hazy, with white foam of tiny bubbles, dissipated quickly leaving fine lace on glass edge.

Very fruity aromas of pineapple, papaya, mango, luscious lemon and even malt!

Immediate bitter hits the tongue which gives way to the fruit flavors and ends sharp grapefruit rind.

This hits all the right notes for an excellent NEIPA for me! Leah prefers the sweeter Heady Topper, whereas I'll stick to this one as my favorite!

Edit.... We had bought two cans, and we drank the second one fiber nights after the first one. I had worked hard on a pool electrical job in the sun that day, and WOW!... What an intense beer to drink after a hot day on the sun. By the time we were on the porch, it had cooled off considerably, and it was raining..... Drinking this Focal Banger was pure joy!

F - medium, leaning on full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth.

Focal Banger,,North Carolina,4.5/5,"Picked up a four-pack from the Stowe brewery 7-29-23 for $13. Canned 7-25-23; consumed the first two for review 7-30-23.

Beer poured a hazy golden with a nice white head that has sustained hang time.

Nose is very nice, fresh citrus abounds from the glass long after pouring.

Taste is spot on. The light pale malt base displays the grapefruit forward hops and it tastes like the pink grapefruit fresh off my tree at my old PHX house in the spring. Finishes with a superb rind and pine bitterness; 7/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is light bodied with each sip very refreshing.

Overall, yep, the hype is correct on this one. This is a world class ipa!","Jul 30, 2023"
Focal Banger,,Texas,4.34/5,"Canned on 7/18/23 - Just 15 days ago!

Drank most from can as directed, but did pour 4 oz amount in rocks glass for appearance 

Appearance – The beer pours a lightly hazed lime-yellow color with a small head of white foam. The head has a good level of retention, fading slowly over time and leaving tons of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

Smell – The aroma is strong of a grapefruit and herbal hop smell mixed with notes of cracker malt and a touch of bread and toast. Other hop aromas of pine and earth, are there as well, with all the aromas having a fresh “raw” like smell. Hints of caramel and a sizeable grass like smell are there as well, giving a rather green smell overall.

Taste – The taste begins with a crisp cracker malt body paired with a lot of the “raw” hop that was present in the nose. An herbal hop is the biggest, but is accompanied by a decent showing of grapefruit as well. Other light earthy flavors mix in as time goes on all while a little bit of caramel and orange that were present upfront fade. The grass that was in the nose also joins the scene, all with a bit of an increase in the hop. Toward the end, the fresh hop taste steps it up even more, giving a quite heave hop pellet like taste to linger on the tongue.

Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a moderate carbonation. For the mix of big fresh hop with crisp body, the middle of the road mouthfeel balances the two attributes rather well.

Overall – A rather fresh, raw hop pellet tasting IPA. I like it, but in some ways a bit unbalanced with bitterness at the end. Certainly, a great brew, although I am not sure it deserves as much hype as it gets.","Jul 28, 2023"
Focal Banger,,Pennsylvania,4.35/5,"Hell of a good tasting beer. I get some bitter citrus and a snappy hop bitter finish. Would not call it hazy by any standard based on taste. I’m drinking from the can as per instructions so can’t say anything about the look.

Focal Banger,,California,4.64/5,"Pours a hazy yellow color.

Aroma: orange and papaya, a little bit of pineapple.

Focal Banger,,North Carolina,4.42/5,"Overall, a very solid IPA and a worthy sibling to Heady Topper. It has more subtle tastes and comes away tasting somewhere between a ne ipa and west coast ipa, with both citrus and pine notes. And yet, it's not overwhelming.","May 30, 2023"
Focal Banger,,,5/5,Better Than Heady,"May 20, 2023"
Focal Banger,,New Jersey,4.54/5,"A: Creamy and hazy tangerine-popsicle coloring with a two inch bone white capping that was bready on the surface and lasting. Beautiful glow of orange when backlighted, is like an alaskan sunset for the last time before the cold winter. Things were a bit to dense to determine effervesce, but the glass showed a smothering of lace bands encompassing the entire drinking vessel. 

S: Wet, and juicy mangos and pineapple for aroma along with some light fresh green melon and peach fruitiness. A touch of wet citrusy nature also chimes in, with some orange floral hops. Cantaloupe and honeydew fruitiness rounds out. There is a respectable amount of fresh whirlpool hopping here, with a touch of semi-dry orange peel upon farther warming. 

T: Unexpectingly a smack down of tart tangerine and orange peel bitterness with semi-dry citrus peel appear first on the tongue, with a bitterness factor off the charts. Dank tropical pineapple-peach combo with a grassy dry hopping overlay. The double dry hopping, or perhaps triple? here certainly is distinguishable, appreciable, and note taking worthy and sure to knock your socks off. Spicy herbal orange peel and flowery hops dry things out a bit, while a lingering grassy pine hop coating smothers the tongue with an unrelenting assault, staying well after the swallow. 

M: Dry, flowery hop coating and feeling on the tongue. Malty depth is there to try to offset the loads of hops with a mid-range carbonation feel. Sticky resins, alkaline bitterness, with a tongue numbing and pulsing of the dry hops are sure make you pay attention. 

O: Overall what more can be said about a beer brewed by those that brought you Heady Topper. While Heady was a delicious fruity tropical poolside drink, this has a fresh wet nose that was similar, but then gave you a knock out punch of dry hopping like a hit from mike tyson in his prime. These guys are true artist when it comes to blending and formulating, and getting the most out of the hop additions, while creating balance and tropical hop bombs that are matched by few. Highly enjoyable, drinkable, and worth the wait, as it seems I am always late or last to the party on these epic beers. But good things come to those who wait. Cheers until your first experience.","May 11, 2023"

Focal Banger,,Pennsylvania,4.43/5,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $5.15. Canned on 01-03-23, so this beer is just 3 1/2 weeks or 25 days old.

Look: It pours a hazy yet translucent golden orange color. It has a frothy, small-bubbled off-white head about 1/8th of a finger tall. Nice head retention.

Smell: Very dank. Lots of hop resins and citrusy orange zest and grapefruit rind. More subtle melon notes (cantaloupe). Green bell pepper on the finish after swirling the glass. It's also a bit of sharp oniony notes.

Taste: It's really delicious. I am impressed at the level of balance in this beer. From the nose, I kind of got the impression that the palate is going to punch me in the face. However, it strikes an impeccable balance between hops and malt and it tastes just moderately bitter with a long-lasting finish. It has a very nice malt base with grainy sweetness. I am not sure if this has any caramel malt in it; I perceive that type of flavor profile. The finish has tons of citrus rind - orange and grapefruit - along with lots of pith and some earthy, woody, resinous pine. That being said, it's surprisingly gentle and restrained with its bitterness. This beer is incredibly easy to drink. The bitterness builds as I drink more of it.

Feel: Softy, chewy mouthfeel. Really nice. Very soft, gentle carbonation. Medium bodied.

Overall: This is my second Alchemist beer. I thought that Heady Topper really lived up to all of its hype, and Focal Banger can hold its own also. Personally I think that I prefer the ""single IPA"" style to the double IPA style, yet it's really hard to call a winner because both of these beers are just so good.","Jan 28, 2023"

Focal Banger,,New Hampshire,4.25/5,"Though I've been to Stowe numerous times, I've never actually had this particular bier.... Well, an Alchemist employee recently dropped off a few of these cans at my work (Stark) and so here's my chance to give it a go....

Poured into a small sniftah, it's a hazy, medium golden-yellow color, with some scattered carbo within. The head is a fluffy, marshmallow-white, 1/4"" layer of creamy foam. It lasts fairly well, with a solid covering, and nice lace left on the glass. Has a rich citrus-fruit aroma - some grapefruit and pineapple, plus a bit of lemon zest, Has a medium to medium-plus body, with a silky smooth feel. 

Flavor has a bit of crackery, biscuity malt, but that aspect is quite understated. What isn't understated is the hoppy character of this brew. There's some subtle, semi-sweet tangerine, but it's mostly bitter fruit that holds sway here. There's some grapefruit, plus lemon zest and a hint of pineapple. It's quite pithy, resiny and piney. The finish is a bit dry, but the pithy, rindy aspect lingers for some time on the palate. Though I'd prefer something a smidge sweeter, this is still a solid brew. Prosit!!

I Let My Tape Rock,,Ohio,4.31/5,"Viscous almost gloppy black out of the bottle, it forms a thin dark tan film that quickly settles to a thin chain.

Significant barrel spice and heat are right up front before the thick body envelopes the palate with maple, coconut, and mocha brownies. The finish actually cleans up and even becomes somewhat crisp to a semi-dry, tingly and only slightly sticky lip smacking swallow.

The barrel is significant here. Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it. This compliments the maple well, while tempering the decadence of the mocha, vanilla and coconut, which is like a swirling creme anglaise throughout.","Jul 30, 2019"

West Ashley,,Oregon,4.59/5,"Most recent batch. Thanks, Sam!

A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime. 

The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation, just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle, coaxing, prodding, this is a truly excellent beer.

In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping.","Mar 29, 2021"
West Ashley,,Indiana,4.58/5,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden orange color with high carbonation and a white head.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was high, erupting from the newly opened bottle. The dry finish had nice lingering power. 

Overall - What a well-crated saison!","Mar 26, 2021"

Smells of ripe apricots, fresh cut flowers, lime zest and wet grass. Got a prominent mushroom funk quality to it, together with cream cheese and moldy earth.

Has a light, mellow mouthfeel with an uprising effervescence during the finish. 

Got a mellow potato peel yeast softness to it, opening up the palate to the beers herbal, prominent funkiness. Turns more sour once the beers effervescence unfolds, bringing apricot pulp and subtle lime zest to the palate. Finishes heavier on the fruits, earth, funk and a long lasting lime bitterness, building up a perfect balance for the apricots.

This is nice, not your typical awa at all with a well established sourness, which accompanies the apricots perfectly well. The funkiness creates a subtle complexity which guides through the whole experience, highlighting the fruits incredibly well.","Jul 15, 2018"

West Ashley,,Virginia,4.55/5,"Bottle is about 2.5 years old. 

A: Orange tinted pale with fizzy white head that quickly disappears to nothingness. 

S: Funky barnyard and earth alongside a good dose of tart apricot, earth, orange, and light oak. 

T: Hay, sour apricot, grainy wheat, a touch of citrus and new oak, and a whiff of tartness that grows to medium-light through the long finish. Sourness is firm but not excessive. The fruit component is noticeable but pretty light at this point. 

M: Medium-light body and medium-high carbonation. 

O: An excellent fruited sour, one of the better American versions; sort of Fou Foune-ish. Doesn’t quite hit the complexity of the Belgians but it’s still damn good.","Nov 23, 2017"

Ephraim,,Connecticut,4.25/5,"Canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.

Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.

A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.","Jun 15, 2022"

Ephraim,,New York,4.23/5,"This one pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit.

This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy.

This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me.

I've been waiting to try this one for a long time now. It's not quite the absolute revelation I was hoping for, but I'm still really with it.","Feb 03, 2020"

Ephraim,,Ohio,4.04/5,"Foggy burnt gold with a fluffy short persistent blanket.

Spicier, sharper and more dank than most of Hill's other IPAs, there's notes of black pepper and a noticeable boozy triple sec character I'm really surprised to experience in a Hill IPA, but at least it makes sense with the ABV. I was expecting a more approachable beer just due to their pedigree, but at 10% I can understand why they don't make this so often, being so far outside of their usual IPA realm. It's not bad though, by all means. There's an additional note of toasted cracker in the medium-light body as the crisp carbonation finishes semi-dry with a hint of vanilla on the exhale.","May 13, 2019"
Ephraim,,New Hampshire,4.28/5,"From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 05/08/19. Served in a tulip.

Pours a hazy, glowing honey-gold with maybe a finger of loose, bubbly suds. For such a scant head, retention is pretty exceptional and leaves a heavy cap of scummy froth. Concentric rings of lacing right to the bottom of the glass.

A fairly low-intensity nose of yeasty bread roll and sweet citrus.

Taste is big and boozy with unexpectedly intense bitterness. Oily orange peel and bitter pith, the whole grapefruit, pith, peel and juice, spicy grass, and maybe a shot of triple sec to boot. Resinous, with tongue-coating hop oils.

Mouthfeel is silky and vodka-like. No more than medium bodied and brightly carbonated. 

Overall, well, this is by far the booziest tasting pale ale I’ve ever had from Hill Farmstead which, at 9.6% abv is, I suppose, only right and proper. Compared with a Triple IPA from a brewer like Trillium, which tends to be thick, heavy and muddled like a juice-based cocktail, Ephraim is relatively light and clean, more reminiscent of a flavored or infused vodka.","May 09, 2019"

Pours dark, frothy creamy head and persistent lacing. Strong scents of cinnamon, coffee, and bourbon barrel over dark malt. Taste is very strong flavors of cinnamon, coffee, dark fruit, cocoa, and bourbon barrel. Damn, does this taste good. Medium bodied, mouth watering, a very barrel forward presence.

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,,Georgia,4.2/5,"8 ounce pour - $10.00 at Woodstock Beer Market in Woodstock, Georgia.

Appearance: Presents a very dark brown-hued body with a slim, scant ring of beige foam.

Smell: Resounding, rich dark maltiness infused with cinnamon-vanilla infused sugar, (subtler) coffee, chocolate powder, German dark bread, dark syrup, dark fruits (all tings dark, really).

Taste: Sweetish dark maltiness of toasted black bread, rounded roasted barley, scorched raw sugars with a mellow-minded earthy, woodsy quality from the spice and barrel. A pleasant, agreeable spiciness, particularly with the cinnamon without venturing into heavy-handed crap-can Red Hot candy territory. Dark fruitiness a little raisiny. Touches of vanilla creme, Dutch stroop. Subtle coffee infusion. Good amount of barrel character, it's certainly warming though never heated or hot. Continued traces of fruit and spice on the silken finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Low carbonation. Smooth, supple mouthfeel.

Overall: Enjoyable.","Feb 09, 2023"

Champurrado, cocoa, cinnamon, and earthy coffee with a hints of kretek in the nose. Very mild.

Intense palate entry, heavy/sharp sweetness with waves of blackstrap, coffee, walnuts, black currant, and fig. Moderate earthy bitterness washed away by the alcohol (hints of rum and irish whiskey, and port more than bourbon) and spice notes in the long medium finish. Low tartness with hints of oak comes and goes.

Rich, creamy, medium-full bodied, with low astringency and good round carbonation. A tiny bit hot perhaps.

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,,Massachusetts,4.31/5,"2022 vintage

Alright, time for the highest rated American Strong Ale, which is quite the ambiguous style, but I’m excited regardless. Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak

It’s a bit more balanced in taste, and very good, but I was expecting this to pop more. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, toasted oak, earthy cinnamon, raisin, earthy whiskey, brown sugar, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, sweetened coffee, milk chocolate, toasted oak, caramel, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms but I wanted more complexity out if it

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a lush yet zippy beer. Finishes dry for everything going on and drinks well below the 13% listed

Given the fact that it improves over the course of drinking it, I have to bump this one up a bit in the overall. Still not everything I was hoping for but very good","Apr 30, 2022"

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,,Washington,4.33/5,"2017 limited release Coffee Cinnamon Barrel Aged B-Bomb, imperial winter ale. Aged (4 years? or nearly 5?) in my cellar and served chilled in a Chimay chalice. Oil slick appearance and a big warm cinnamon nose that fills the room. Really that aroma is hard to beat. Flavor is creamy and mouth-encompassing with waves of caramel, cinnamon candy. Ultra-fine carbonation adds milkiness to the mouthfeel. Mocha and coffee flavors are initially mellowed but there's a more pronounced coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Vanilla flavors from the bourbon are also mellow, and I don't get any harsh whisky flavor at all. Pretty amazing for 13.0% ABV. World-Class absolutely describes it. I don't believe I've ever had this fresh, but I have no regrets about aging it this long.","Dec 25, 2021"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,,New Jersey,4.53/5,"2019 Vintage

Pours out a dark brown, nearly black liquid. Aggressive pour yields a half of a finger of khaki head. The foam sticks around for a while. It didn't look too thick on the way into the glass. Stouts just have a certain way of looking and you can guess that this might not be one.

Nose indicates that it's definitely not a stout. Coffee comes forward first, but not in your face with roasty qualities. There's actually a slight hint of sweet fruitiness that accompanies this coffee. Reminds me of Jamaican Blue with its delicate, fruit-forward tones. Next is the presence of molasses spice cookie. There's this mildly bitter, peppery, spicy sort of thing lurking underneath. It smells quite captivating so far, if a little on the weak side. 

Taste is everything that was in the nose and more. A natural evolution. Mildly roasty and fruity coffee, cinnamon, bitter black strap molasses, a faint bourbon/oak, black pepper, but without the heat, and dark grainy bread. Along the lines of rye or pumpernickel. I got that in the previous B-Bomb I had as well. Very unique quality. These flavors unravel spectacularly, never once stepping over each others toes or vying for attention. Nicely balanced, not too bitter, not sickly sweet. 

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Not thick like a stout, but a nice density. Not too cloying, alcohol evaporation drying it up a little. Mild carbonation.

Overall a fantastic brew for the winter. A great sipper to have with friends and to ponder life and enjoy a snowy winter landscape. Cheers to Fremont who continuously knocks it out of the park.","Dec 23, 2021"
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,,Pennsylvania,4.68/5,"2019 version, aged at Fremont purchased through Tavour. My second version of B-bomb, but I haven't had the base beer yet.

This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels.

Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes.

Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019.

Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so.","Oct 09, 2021"

L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does

S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat

T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot

F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?)

M: thick, heavy and oily

Adios Ghost,,Canada (AB),4.99/5,"I am not even sure where to start or what to say. Monkish is on another level than most, and this is the best I have had from them. Juicy but not too sweet, just enough heat, and cleansing bitterness.","Dec 11, 2018"
Adios Ghost,,California,4.93/5,One of the best beers so far I had from Monkish. Nice citrus smell to it and murky Yellow color; with the first taste not hoppy taste but a sweet juicy taste for a triple. Not over powering of taste at all just a perfect balance to it! Very creamy texture to it; this is definitely a perfect brew!,"Nov 28, 2018"
Adios Ghost,,New York,4.45/5,"This one pours a very hazy and murky yellow, with a small head and lots of lacing.

This smells like orange pineapple juice dumped into a bag of lawn clippings. It’s pretty raw, but not boozy, which is pleasant. There’s tons of juicy goodness, and a healthy and zesty bitterness on the finish.

This has a juicy finish, with a nice crispness, and barely any boozy character.

Adios Ghost,,Alabama,4.79/5,"Canned 12/12/17. ‘I’m Gone.’

Pours a very pale golden yellow, very similar to the ‘Foggy Window’ series color. Not much head, patches of bubbly lace.

Citrusy, slightly boozy, bitter, hoppy, a little bit of everything. Not overpowering, perfect balance.

Again, wow. Tropical, citrus, lingering hop bitterness, so creamy. Absolutely incredibly smoothness for 10%.

Creamy, smooth, nice burn down the hatch. But for a 10% I really think this is unmatched.","Jan 11, 2018"
Curiosity Twenty Seven,,Germany,4.52/5,"2 months old. Can to wine glass.

L: Pours a full and hazy orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Some very tiny floaters visible.

S: Sweet and hoppy with notes of candied citrus fruits paired with bubblegummy strawberry notes.

T: Grapefruit, orange and lime. Strawberry and peach as well. Hoppy and grassy. Less sweet than its taste with a bitter finish.

F: Full and juicy, almost creamy. Quite sharp. Medium carbonation

Curiosity Twenty Seven,,Minnesota,4.44/5,"Canned on 3-7-2023 consumed on 4-2-2023 

Poured from the can. The color is quite hazy, murky, and juicy looking. no light comes through when held up to the light. The head that this beer produces is 2 finger, white, and frothy looking. The head retention is decent, and there's a ton of lacing on the glass. 
The aroma is quite dominated by the hops. It is juicy smelling. I get mango, grapefruit, and pineapple on the nose. 
The flavor is very juicy, and has the flavors I mentioned in the aroma. There's a bit of mango up front that fades to the grapefruit and pineapple on the back. These latter flavors really linger on my taste buds and in my throat. Heck, I will be burping pineapple and grapefruit for a while. 
The body feels quite full, soft feeling, and juicy. 
I am fairly burnt out on this style, however, when it's done right, I love it. This is done right.","Apr 02, 2023"

The pour was a dark shade of orange and translucent with a paper white head that left sheets of lacing.
Aroma is sadly still not working for me.
The taste though, very nice assortment of fruit notes; peach foremost and tangerine and a hint of grapefruit. The balance is amazing.
The feel is darn near perfect, it may be perfect but my lack of experience with the style keeps me from knowing. In any case, smooth and soft and the ABV is not at all noticeable.

Curiosity Twenty Seven,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Pours a viscous burnt orange color with a creamy white head that literally paints the glass. Absolutely lovely hazy. The nose is filled with dank tangerine and grapefruit rind and some peach notes. Wow.

The taste is rife with the tangerine and grapefruit rind flavors, but I really digging the pronounced peach flavor and that nice little dollop of sweet oats at the back of the palate that is delicious and so balanced that you get no sense that you’re drinking an 8% ABV NEDIPA. World class stuff, IMHO.

The mouthfeel is well carbed, juicy, and on the softer side. If you’re a hazy fan, Tree House is the standard you should seek, IMHO.","Mar 19, 2023"
Curiosity Twenty Seven,,Massachusetts,4.53/5,"A re-release of a classic treehouse beer. A beer that I hadn’t ticked off. Didn’t need to get more beer but when the opportunity presents itself to grab a good rare brew, you go to the brewery , taking one for the team. I know , how noble of me 

Brewers Notes: Our curiosity continues with an intensely kettle and dry hopped Double IPA primarily featuring Amarillo! The base of Twenty Seven is straightforward to allow the unique and intriguing characteristics of Amarillo to shine. We experience flavors and aromas of grapefruit flesh, tangerine, and peach. It evokes memories of 22… Our house yeast provides a familiar character and intermingles beautifully with this precious and distinctive hop. Despite its focused and intense flavors, this Curiosity drinks softly… dangerous and beautiful.

Hazy orange liquid poured into a pretentious beer glass 

Aroma is orange citrus , whiff of grapefruit 

Taste is orange citrus, grapefruit , tangerine , melon, hint of peach 

Deceptively smooth , 8% abv is very well hidden

Curiosity Twenty Seven,,Massachusetts,4.46/5,"Canned 3/7/23. “Explore your mind” stamped on the bottom of the can

Yet another Curiosity re-brew, this one having climbed its way to #74 overall on BA. That’s pretty cool. I didn’t even know what when I decided to grab this one, I just think the re-brews of this series lately have been fun. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a hazy dark orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

This one has a fruit candy vibe in the nose, almost like a Starburst. That may sound cloying but it works well. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, orange marmalade, bready malt, banana, grassy hops, papaya, light pine, and pineapple juice

And it holds up in taste, it’s pretty similar and I’m perfectly fine with that. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe cantaloupe, juicy strawberry, orange juice, banana, bready malt, earthy hops, and light papaya. The swallow brings notes of overripe cantaloupe, orange juice, grassy hops, papaya, pineapple juice, vanilla, and light banana

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a juicy beer. Finishes neutral and a bit sweet but still balanced

This one is very good. Very tropical and smooth yet balanced. Glad I picked this one up","Mar 11, 2023"

F: mouthfeel on this is very smooth and goes down super-easy.

Overall - a great offering from TH. was a little let down by the absurdly high ratings, but aside from that, a great brew","Nov 14, 2016"
Curiosity Twenty Seven,,New York,4.9/5,"Canned 11/2/16. Consumed 11/13/16.

A: Beer pours a deep gold color. Sits in the glass a dark orange color with about a finger of the tightest, most pillowy off-white head that seems to defy the laws of physics with how long it sticks around. Thick lacing sticks the glass, along with some alcohol legs that more than hint at the ABV.

S: Overripe peach and... well.... more overripe peach. Seriously, the amount of peach on the nose is insane (the label doesn't lie...). Underneath, I lots of pineapple, some mango, and maybe some sweeter, spritzy tangerine juice. Not so much the fleshy, pithy citrus notes, but more of the sweet juice. And there's definitely some of that Juicy Fruit bubblegum smell, but it's more subtle than in Green, Julius, and the other DIPAs. 

T: Follows the nose, though maybe not as intense on the initial taste. Unlike some TH DIPAs, which taste kinda like drinking the juice concentrate given how pungent they can be, up front, this one is much more like biting into a fresh yellow peach. It quickly transitions into a sweet bubblegum flavor complemented by the lightest and fluffiest bready malt. On the finish, this one really shines with waves of insane flavor. Sticky, overripe peach comes back along with apricot, mango floral pine, and bitter grapefruit peel. Pithy citrus and peach flavors linger forEVER, accompanied by a medium bitterness that just sits on the middle of the tongue.

M: How the hell is this 8%? Seriously, this drinks like 6% given the lack of malt, booze, etc., but has the creaminess that you'd expect from a Tree House DIPA. The softness and smoothness is nothing new by the brewery's standards, but the lightness is really unique. Given the medium bitterness and medium dryness on the finish, C-27 is dangerously easy to drink way too quickly. If anything, the lack of flavor intensity on the front end actually enhances the drinkability. 

O: This is a really insane beer. It's quite different from the other TH DIPAs in that it's more complex than a simple assault of juicy hops. I find it to be softer, creamier, and more variegated throughout the taste. The flavors seem to build after the sip and really hit their stride a second or two after the sip. The amount of peach and mango flavor/aroma is crazy, and the floral piney bitterness that lingers on the finish perfectly complements the juicy, tropical profile. With a slightly bigger nose and maybe a bit more intensity on the initial taste, this would be up there with my favs from them. But it's really not far off right now!","Nov 13, 2016"
Curiosity Twenty Seven,,California,4.68/5,"Thanks to Dave for the growler

L: Hazy per usual from Tree House beers. Golden orange hue.

S:Pineapples and a few other fruits, but mmm pineapples.

T: Very nice fruit forward IPA with a soft bitterness on the backend. Hodgepodge of pineapple, orange, and other citrus fruits.

M: Very Nice creamy mouthfeel

F: Requisite soft, creamy, and delicate Tree House mouthfeel - oddly reminiscent of JJJulius
O: I've been fortunate to have more than my fair share of Tree House beers, but this one truly stands out from the pack. Curiosity 22 was my first of the Curiosity series (and long my favorite), but Tree House somehow went back to the well and engineered an even better Curiosity beer. I have no idea how they do it, but C27 is the new favorite of the Curiosity series in my book.

Curiosity Twenty Seven,,Connecticut,4.74/5,"I love the Tree House Beers and am lucky to live close enough to have them in regular rotation. This is one of the best.

Awesome fluffy mouthfeel, you get no sense of the alcohol. Actually reminds me of Juice Machine but with just a bit more of the finishing bitterness that I like. Possibly my favorite beer ever. I am sad to only have three cans left.","Nov 10, 2016"

Aroma is pineapple with biscuit on back end. Not the super strong aroma typical of other th iPas. 

Taste is where this beer shines. Up front biscuit malt followed by pineapple . Get a little caramel late as well. Very tasty . 

Mouthfeel is super creamy. One of creamiest iPas I have ever had from treehouse. And that is saying a lot.

Saison Du Fermier,,Maine,4.26/5,"Thank you not2quick for this one!

750ml bottle - blend 5 - poured into a chalice at 50°F. 

Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence.

Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display.

Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling.

Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in. A top tier American oak-aged saison.","Feb 16, 2021"

This is basically perfect stuff here. It's so well balanced - all the different complex flavors meld together perfectly into exactly what I think of when I think of American saison. There's some funky honey and citrusy flavors, along with tart white wine and grape skin, cider, barnyard funk, but mild, and oak and vanilla. There's a lot going on, and it's all good.

Tangy and lightly sour, flavors of green apple come along with an excellently balanced note of bright wine oak that adds an infinite complexity of grapes, orange rind and a hint of olive brine, becoming more acidic as it warms. 

The round, medium body comes in with a light, tingly fizz and finishes just barely semi-dry.

Continuing with stouts, I chose this from Prairie. Using my Jester tulip glass, I let the beer warm up to 56 degrees. A hard pour created a half finger, medium dark tan head. The retention is dismal, and dropped as fast as it formed. The color of the beer charts arounds SRM 36, dark brown with ruby hues. The beer is opaque but does show some carbonation bubbles on the sides of the glass. Overall the appearance is average for this style, I wanted to see a longer lasting head. 

Nosing the beer, I detect dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut with espresso. After smelling the beer several more times, I notice caramel, bourbon, oak, hints of floral, dates, raisins, slight char, roasted malts, bready, and a touch of Maillard. 

The chocolate weaves coconut with vanilla seamlessly. Other flavors in the beer are caramel, bready, roasted maltiness, raisins, figs, oak, bourbon, oak, anise, soy sauce, oranges, hints of floral, Maillard, and char. 

The heavy roasted malts gives the beer a heavy body and a low carbonation. A chewy thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish. 

The beer is tasty, yet I have a few complaints. I wanted more coconut flavors and less char. Overall the beer is a wonderful example of Imperial stout. I enjoyed sipping this one on a cold winter night.","Jan 06, 2023"

Bourbon Paradise,,Maryland,4.5/5,"On tap at Frisco Taphouse in Crofton, MD.

Bourbon Paradise,,Tennessee,4.63/5,"It's incredibly rich and decadent....it's delicious....perhaps the thickest creamiest beer I've ever had... the bourbon is quite evident, as it should be... the coconut wafts in and out like a ghost....incredibly intense experience....having this on Black Friday morning while cooking a breakfast casserole... warming to the belly after a few healthy sips...this is a real banger. 

The sort of beer you pull out for just the right moment.. I love it...one is enough due to its intensity and richness...

A masterpiece...","Nov 25, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,Florida,4.28/5,"Poured from bottle to wine glass. Super dark color with rich brown head. Totally opaque, head is very small and is soon totally gone, there is some lacing however. Strong scents of soy sauce and dark malt, I like this though it is bordering on being too strong. Taste, there is a lot here. Extremely rich, strong flavors of raw coconut, bourbon, soy sauce, roasted malts, licorice. It is delicious but it is simply too much. The beer is creamy and the finish is incredibly long. A great beer but it is just not for me.","Oct 01, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,Ohio,4.45/5,"Look - Fantastic looking BA Stout! Black and thick with a really nice thick tan head and fantastic rimming and lacing. Not sure what you can do better
Smell - nutty dark chocolate woody smell. I'm sure that nut smell comes from the coconut but I don't get the coconut, more just nut. maybe some molasses caramel deep in there
Taste - a little sweet but not overly sweet. dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla. 
Feel - Medium full body with a medium light carb, slight creaminess
Overall - I like how the vanilla and coconut aren't overly done and instead just bring out some great flavors of the beer in different ways. The Barrel to this beer is fantastic. Well done not overly sweet BA Stout","Sep 15, 2022"

Bourbon Paradise,,,4.7/5,"Fantastic! Before getting into the flavor, I greatly appreciate this brew being offered in 12 oz bottles. Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge. That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week. I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that. As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile. I liken it to Phil Anselmo holding back in Cemetery Gates, unleashing at just the right time. It goes without saying, but drink this one slowly, as the flavor profile changes as it warms. Enjoy the ride.","Jun 24, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,Indiana,4.68/5,"Appearance - The beer poured thick blackness with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. 

Smell - Dark chocolate was most prominent in the nose. Coconut was faint in the nose. 

Taste - Initially, the dark chocolate led the way. It was like a bourbon barrel aged Mounds bar. The chocolate and coconut worked so well together. The sweetness of the coconut was most prominent in back. The bourbon made for a warming finish. 

Mouthfeel - The body was thick with roasted chocolate. Carbonation was largely non-existent. 

Overall - This was a great coconut stout.","Mar 26, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,California,4.14/5,"Packaged on 11/20/2020 - consumed on 3/13/2022. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Portsmouth tulip. 

Dark seal brown to bistre body with a thin fawn/camel collar. Vague lacing; fast running legs; poor retention. 

Vanilla, barrel char, bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of tobacco, molasses, cocoa, and toffee in the nose. 

Intense palate entry - all of the flavors above but concentrated. Rather sweet, with a long chocolate-laden finish. Some barrel/alcohol elements along with a gentle, clean bitterness add a little balance. Stewed dark fruit notes emerge as the ale warms. Neutral yeast character. Coconut and vanilla seem a little redundant, overwhelming their counterparts in the bourbon flavor, and reinforcing the borderline cloying impression.

Silky, almost oily, rich mouth-feel with active yet low carbonation. Moderately warming.

More on the dessert end of the spectrum for the style, but very potent with some balanced barrel influence. Enjoyed it more than my notes might suggest.","Mar 13, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,Colorado,4.52/5,"Little to no head. Only a very thin tan ring clinging to the glass. Very dark like dark chocolate cake. The nose is chocolate and more chocolate. Bourbon comes right out of the middle of the chocolate. Vanilla and barrel leak out at the end. The taste has bourbon, vanilla, and oak jumping right out. Chocolate and a small hint of coconut follow. There is a small bit of spice that hides behind the coconut at the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but with the right amount of carbonation. This is a wonderful beer. It wants to be too sweet but stops just short and balances out to make you smile. (Found old notes on this one)","Feb 21, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,Indiana,4.13/5,"2019 version enjoyed 27 months later.

Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film.

Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel.

Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel.

Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer.

I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at.","Jan 30, 2022"
Bourbon Paradise,,,5/5,"Wonderful brew. So far, my favorite.","Dec 29, 2021"
Bourbon Paradise,,Florida,4.13/5,"Poured a black body with minimal head and touch of lace patches but those quickly dissipate. The aroma is mostly booze to me, although some sugariness comes in as well so assume this is vanilla. Smooth beer, kind of buttery it's so slick, with a hot and boozy taste and feel with vanilla sweetness but also some slickness from hints of coconut. Real easy to drink for a slow sipper and there is a good amount of chocolate throughout the beer that balances well with the vanilla and coconut.","Sep 30, 2021"
Bourbon Paradise,,New York,4/5,"BBA imperial (13.7% abv) stout featuring vanilla and coconut...

Nothing wrong here, but its an unexceptional take on the style - that said, yes - you get bourbon, you get vanilla, and you get coconut, too - high-abv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee - maybe I'm just jaded - this 12 oz. bottle was $9.99 IIRC - Prairie being notoriously high-priced (right? lol) - so in sum, you get what they advertise, but to my tastes it doesn't do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks, or to justify the price... Fans of vanilla and coconut BBA stouts will absolutely dig this though...","Sep 18, 2021"
Bourbon Paradise,,District of Columbia,3.69/5,"$12.99 per 12 oz. 13.7% ABV. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip.

Too much upon the first sip. Of course, after the initial shock your taste buds acclimate a bit. But overall, this ale goes too far with is coconut, vanilla, and sweetness. Thought the barrel-aging contributes to these faults I do not believe that’s where the mistakes were made. 3.5

A – Pours an opaque oily black, viscous with zero head. Syrupy. An alcohol “wedge” (not legs) on the glass. 4.25

S – Sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, coconut is on the faint side and seems to be overwhelmed by the other aromas. There are some roasted aromas as well, but behind everything else. A very complex aroma. 4.0

T – Coconut!!! Sweet. Alcohol is well hidden. No bitterness. Sweetness is a combo of the coconut and the brown sugar flavors. No spiciness to balance, just the ABV. 3.5

MF – Heavy bodied, sweet with a spirited finish, but not hot. 3.75","Aug 28, 2021"
Bourbon Paradise,,Indiana,4.5/5,"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Fits the style perfectly, IMHO. The nose is led by the bourbon, but it’s surprisingly not too hot, and there’s a really nice vanilla note to accompany the dark chocolate and char notes, and there’s maybe a smidge of coconut.

Dark chocolate leads the taste, accompanied by the bourbon, and balanced by the vanilla and a more substantial coconut flavor. This is hefty and brawny, yet also well balanced, something that requires a lot of skill from the brewery in my experience. Prairie definitely has that skill set.

The mouthfeel is rich and slightly creamy, well suited to the beer. I really liked the base beer - a LOT - and this is better, IMHO. World class stuff here.","Jul 04, 2021"
Bourbon Paradise,,Texas,4.45/5,"Appearance: Very black glass shows an angry ruby red edge with strong back light. Doesn't hold a head.

Aroma: Soy sauce, sour barrel note, some very dark malt.

Taste: Sweet, but holds short of cloying. Deep malt, barrel notes, bourbon, mild citric note, chocolate, dark fruit (raisin), maybe a little vanilla? 

Mouthfeel: Heavy body, no carbonation, chew, oily texture, fairly clean finish with a oily coat.

Overall: Like bourbon? Yeah, plenty of that here, but it's a malt bomb. Very sweet, dense, almost brownie like. A good one to share or sip slowly.","Jun 05, 2021"

Taste is incredibly rich vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate, bourbon, and a second wave of coconut on the finish. Feel is absolutely incredible— thick, silky and viscous. It’s like drinking melted chocolate. A pronounced alcohol warmth seals the deal. Make no mistake, this is an incredible beer, but the bourbon finish is almost so rich that it’s a bit unbalanced.

The Rusty Nail,,Washington,4.46/5,"Poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a tulip. This is the 2023 vintage release; this version is 14.1%. I had this beer ages ago when it first came out, but I'm just getting around to reviewing it now!

Appearance: dark as a moonless night with a starless sky. Impenetrable. Head is a thin layer of tan foam; that could be a little nicer.

Smell: cinnamon right up front, but with enough vanilla from the bourbon and a dash of licorice to really give the feeling of a sweet bread. I mean, this thing is as sweet as summer days are long, but the overall vibe is ""great big hug from a panadería"" and I am very much into it

Taste: sweet, of course, but with a very bakery-like sensibility, as in the aroma. The licorice and alcohol give the otherwise sweet cinnamon-roll flavor a more mature dimension. I really love the complexity of flavor and juxtaposition of elements here. It's diabetes in a bottle, but hey, I don't really need these feet!

Mouthfeel: rich body with a good carbonation and a smooth, satisfying creaminess. Maybe not perfectly silky, but damn fine.

Overall: the drinkability for a 14.1% BA stout is truly astounding. This beer is a sugar bomb; I'm really going to have some explaining to do after my next A1C evaluation. However, that doesn't mean this beer isn't goo-ooo-ood.","Sep 12, 2023"
The Rusty Nail,,Nevada,4.11/5,"Yet another time to be alive pour, this one also came during the tap takeover for BeerNV right before the Alabama show at Lake Tahoe. This was the 2022 version. 

Pours black. Even though its the same color as a stout, I expected greater viscosity. Didn't amass much of a head. Some brown cherry cola like head but it was thin, 1/6"". Blew a hole down the middle. The aroma didn't yield much in the way of roasted malt, it put a much heavier influence on the barrel(s). Sweet bourbon and/or whiskey notes dominate. 

The taste gets a little more complex, perhaps its the stuff I loathe like licorice or cinnamon bark, actually making a yield that is more enjoyable than the sum of its parts. The mouth feel isn't hot or bitter like I was expecting, its a real smooth showcase for a pretty big beer, but it doesn't have that challenging edge that extreme advocate seems to desire. 

Its a pretty nice big beer and I don't like big beers that much lately.","Aug 07, 2023"

The taste reveals the licorice and cinnamon bark. They pair nicely and do not dominate as I feared. I'm wary of cinnamon in beer, but the deft hand of the brewers keeps things in harmony.

Mouthfeel is luxurious and finish is barrel. Not too hot but the booze is felt. There’s enough carbonation to satisfy.","Jul 23, 2023"

The Rusty Nail,,California,4.53/5,"2022 edition - 13.6% ABV - poured from a 22oz waxed bomber into a snifter. 

Seal brown body with a rouse-able dun/desert sand event horizon; good retention for what's there; fine sandy lacing, sticky thin tears. 

Cocoa, molasses, cinnamon, baked oatmeal, sugar (demerara with hints of muscovado), tobacco, vanilla, and coconut in the nose. Sweet, complex, and balanced. 

The flavor follows the nose but is joined by a wave of chocolate covered cherries, plum torte, cloves, faint poblano, sweet hay, and more. Malty and rich with hints of toasted nuts and 'smores in addition to black licorice and cinnamon. Medium earthy finish with the base beer shining through like the best oatmeal cookie you've had. Hints of ceylon tea at times. Low bitterness throughout. Flavors are not quite integrated - curious how this would age.

Slick, oily, full-bodied mouthfeel, low tannins, and lush carbonation. Well hidden ABV.

The Rusty Nail,,Maryland,4.7/5,"2022 batch, 13.6% ABV.

Pours a nearly pitch-black color. Befitting a huge, barrel-aged monster, there isn't much head, just a tan collar topping it off. 

The aroma, though, is out of this world good. The focus here is on roasted malt, espresso, licorice, and baker's cocoa. A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth. There's a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around, which is good: too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness. And of course, the assertive bourbon barrels can't be overlooked. Tons of oak, vanilla, and bit of corn shine through. 

While the taste doesn't follow the nose super-close, it's wonderful in its own way. It starts off with a nice, sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other (frankly lesser) cinnamon-adorned beers. Same with the bourbony finish: it's subtle yet noticeable, without being massively assertive. Dark chocolate, espresso, roast, and licorice round out the middle - again, enough to make you think, but not enough to overpower. There's a ton of stuff going on with this one, and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy. The more I consume, the more I love it, therefore it earns an elusive 5 taste-wise. 

It's not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts, but by no means is it bone-dry. I could use a touch more body and thickness, but that's me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits. It's still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrel-aged stout. Carbonation is low, but it doesn't need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently. 

I'm always that guy saying beer X doesn't live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100. This, though, this lives up to the hype and then some. It's one of the most complex stouts I've ever sampled, and - like I said - isn't complex in a ""some is good, therefore too much is even better"" kind of way. It's wonderfully cohesive and well-rounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are. An absolute masterpiece, seek it out yesterday!","Aug 14, 2022"

The Rusty Nail,,Connecticut,4.56/5,"Sampling this 2021 vintage 22 oz bottle poured into my trusty snifter. Beer is part of a swap with @Resistance88 thank you!
The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass. No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure.
the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass.
The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note. I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much. I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%. Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose.

First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation. Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip.
Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose. I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose?? Not really any char or heavy roast notes here. The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps. Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops! I dont get any on the flavor profile.
So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm.
The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot. I got a second bottle of another beer to open after this, but I may just sip this one all night.
Very good brew!","May 20, 2022"
The Rusty Nail,,Michigan,4.74/5,"Pour as black as black can be and the light brown head was sparse, short and faded quickly.
The aroma spoke more of bourbon than oatmeal, which is typical, (Oatmeal generally affects to feel more than the flavor for me in most cases) but I wasn't sure what to expect. The malts were very present, rich and deep. Strong coffee, cinnamon and bakers cocoa all made their appearance.
Taste followed, no new surprises awaited me except the sheer level of flavors that came at me. The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise.

Alright, I've obtained the highest rated Oatmeal Stout! This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about

Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw

The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet

This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex. I would love to know what this is like fresh but this is a treat regardless","Feb 21, 2022"

Been chasing it for over a decade and happy to score a few back in 2020 and sitting on them for about a year and a half. Super sweet but not cloying, roasty and smoky without being off-putting. Pretty boozy in the nose, signifying it could use even more time to mellow. Luckily I have another bottle for years down the road. So smooth and easy-drinking but SO full of complex flavors. The best flavor in the finish is roasted marshmallows, without a doubt. Such a fun beer to drink. Epic stuff.","Feb 14, 2022"

Smell: notes of licorice and dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee. 

Taste: one of the most intense and smoothest aged oatmeal stouts that I have ever had. No “cough syrup” sting, but notes of licorice, chocolate, and cherry. Nice finish, very smooth. 

Feel: smooth and bold. 

I am a huge fan of Fremont, so there is some bias. In winters past, my wife loved barrel aged imperial stouts, so this type of “beer” is familiar. This is intense. I’m half way through the bottle (by myself) for dinner and it continues to be an enjoyable sipping beer that will have me in good spirits for the rest of the night. I’m interested in the other bottles of limited release after enjoying this.","Jan 02, 2022"
The Peach,,Kentucky,4.34/5,"Never giving up on those childhood snacks de Garde takes the influence of fruit rollup and rolls it into a winey, earthy, tart and spicy wild ale. With lambic influences at the helm at well, this fruit rollup is corked, capped and ready for adulthood.

Pale gold and lightly of chrome, the light and yeasty haze of The Peach teems with bubbles while building a loose necklace of foam. Pulling from its white wine appearance, the session kicks of with a plume of stone fruit over a citrusy, tangy, earthy, briney perfume chocked full of both funk and fauna. As its mild mannered sweetness greets the tongue, the suggestions of communion wafer, sourdough and a hint of tafffy gives a soft and wheaten buffer to start.

As the malt sweetness bounces effortlessly from the palate, the tastebuds soon carry the brunt of acidity that pangs away with lemon, lime, white grape, crabapple, yuzu and passionfruit with a stronger acidic twinge. All the while, the peach character gives a melon-like roundness for a smooth stone fruit taste. Nearly apricot, mango and orange-like, the bright and ripe peach flavor is radiant. Trending peppery with dry oak and lightly bittered hops, hints of grapefruit, grape seed and a mossy earthiness provide an earthy and peppery exit from the palate.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the off-clean ale finishes briskly acidic with a series of short sourdough echoes laced with peppery white wine, saddle leather and oak tannin.","Sep 12, 2023"
The Peach,,Washington,4/5,"2022-12-25
750ml capped/corked bottle served in a pair of little Cantillon stemmed glasses. Bottled 10/21.

Pours clear, light golden, with a small ghost of a head that disappears and leaves a tiny ring around the glass. Smell is tart and funky. A bit of wood, some dry chardonnay. Something musty. Very interesting.

Taste is dry, tart, very chardonnay buttery, peach / stonefruit notes are there but kind of drowned out by the woody / chardonnay notes. Tartness is somewhere between unripe peaches and lemons. Mustiness is some combination of the butter and wood notes I think.

Mouthfeel is medium to light, super dry, slight filminess, gives a sense of liveliness that might just be prickly acidity. Overall, it's good and very interesting.","Dec 25, 2022"
The Peach,,Illinois,4.37/5,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch","Aug 30, 2022"

The Peach,,Illinois,4.26/5,"750ml bottle, aged in oak barrels, undated, poured into a stemless wine glass. 

The beer pours a bright peach color, orange and gold hues, cloudy with a finger of fizzy white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of fresh peach, bright and lightly tart with a nice floral quality, underlying fruitiness, lightly bacterial with a nice funk, soft oak and earthiness. The flavors are great, tons of peach, juicy, fresh, bright and tart with a nice oak barrel, sweet and chewy with a nice mustiness and funkiness while a soft floral bouquet opens up as it warms. The mouthfeel is good, coating with a delicate and lively medium body that has a nice tartness and finishes with a lightly dry bite.

Verdict: A nice wild ale from de Garde. Lots of peach, bright, fresh, just a touch sweet that really demonstrates the great qualities of the peach.","Jan 16, 2021"

The Peach,,Colorado,4.45/5,"one of the beers i have been after for a long time has finally become a reality, definitely one i have been keen on, so cool to have beery friends out there! this is unique in that its not just a peach wild ale, but one aged in cognac barrels, really complex and good. its got a high shine and a pale color, bright but less than fully clear through most of the bottle, some little bubbles coming up, but somewhat unremarkable visually. it smells a bit more sour than a lot of the de garde beers have been in my experience so far, really piquant, slight vinegar character, white wine acidity, clean though, less funky, and i get the cognac immediately, some sweetness and some alcohol warmth to it, with the very natural peach its almost a baked dessert complexion, light vanilla and graham and even tobacco to it, nice complexity but very sour it seems. the peach is crazy juicy and real and ripe, very authentic here, and i knew it would be based on the other fruit beers ive had in the past from these guys, man i wish i had a reliable supply of their stuff! the flavor here is excellent, again more sour than expected, but its a clean and lightly citrusy sourness, it seems built to balance the sweetness of the peach and even highlight its essence, the peach is bold from beginning to end here. the wood is strong, but the beer itself is quite light, minimal on the grain side, the peach really leads the way. the cognac though is an amazing tough, and im not sure this would be anywhere near as exciting without it, despite the obvious quality. its nutty and deeper than the oak alone, a golden raisin hint maybe, a sweet alcoholic layer, even cigar or something in the mix, just crazy, its amazing with the peach. i get a little less of the de garde funk that i like so much, more generic acidity, so i would enjoy more funkiness, but i cant complain. this was awesome overall, different awesome than expected, but great and really distinct with this combination of fruit and barrel. i hate to admit i had a little sinus thing going on and may have not experienced this in its full glory as a result, cant control those things and certainly wasnt going to pass on it, so i will look forward to hopefully having this again. i love this brewery, its always a joy to drink their beers. this appears worthy of its hype!","Dec 26, 2019"
The Peach,,Massachusetts,4.49/5,"A- Hazy golden body. Two finger creamy cap with good retention. Small sheets of lacing form after each sip.

S- Oh peachy beast. Great whole fruit, flesh and skin and pit peach authenticity. Stone fruit full on and in your face. Some lactic, funk and oak. Not much cognac here. Peaches and sourness are the driving forces.

T- Sour peach saturation. Beautiful ripe peaches with tart and somewhat bitter skin notes. Strong lactic acid sourness. Peach pith and juice bordering on nectar level. Vinous oak with a slight touch of cognac. A bit of Brett funk as time goes on.

MF- Crisp and light-medium bodied overall. A very high level of carbonation and a fluffy and foamy texture. Very sour and somewhat oily slick finish.

The Peach,,Ohio,4.06/5,"Semi-clear filling to hazy dark orange with a khaki blanket that fizzles out quickly to nothing.

It's pretty wild how drastically de Garde beers vary from one to the next, even within the same The series.

This one's ultra funky and oaky up front, then finishes quite sour. The funk is woody and a little cheesy, like blue with walnut and cashew, as the bright peach accent brings in some pear and overripe sweaty ass fruit under a hot sun. The prickly medium-light body swallows sharply sour and oaky, finishing dry.","Jun 14, 2019"
The Peach,,Oregon,3.97/5,"Thanks, to either Sam or Brian for this one. September 2018 release, 6.5%

A clear light orange with a dense, white head with good retention and lacing, this looks solid. The nose is quite exciting. The combination of cognac and peaches is inspired and genuinely works. The star of the show, however, are the peaches. Bright, ripe juicy as well as sour, semi-ripe peaches are present, fleshy, pulpy, juicy. A touch of vanilla as well. The palate opens with a bright and explosive peach character but unfortunately carried on a base beer that's pretty intensely sour. Strong lactic acid sourness with preserved lemons and a lemonade are present. A large peach note, a blend of ripe, juicy peaches and semi-raw, mildly tannic ones, are is present up front. Notes of cognac are present on the mid-palate and are mostly hidden by the peach and the lactic notes. Medium-light in body and softly carbonated and drying and sour on the finish with a blend of peach and lactic sourness with a little cognac. I am surprised by how sour this is, it reminds me of a 6 year old Fou'foune instead of a fresh beer. The sourness does hamper the balance and drinkability some. Still, this is quite enjoyable.

The Peach,,New York,4.03/5,"This one pours with a very clear light orange hue, with a small head and not much lacing.

This smells like funky cognac, sour peach, acidity/vinegar, and a sort of mineral funk.

This is one of the more acidic de Garde beers I've had- it's bracingly sour, with the peaches adding a big additional tartness. The cognac adds a touch of funky sweetness to tone down the acidity a bit, but it doesn't cut it a whole lot. There's a prickly mineral finish a bit too.

This is light bodied, with a prickly and highly sour mouthfeel- with that feeling lingering long after each sip.

S: Pretty aromatic—I can smell the beer from my glass two feet away. Ripe peach, tart lemony twang, earth and light horse blanket. A little spice and leather as it opens up.

T: Moderate-high, bracing sourness that sort of shocks you into coherence, with a moderate undertone of peach, tangerine and light funk and barnyard. Long, mouth-pickering lemon and stone fruit finish. 

M: Medium-light body and medium-high carbonation.

Label stamped “BOTTLED ON 020823”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 49.8 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 55.9 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25
First pour – Gold (SRM 5), clear.
Body – Deep Gold (SRM 6), chill haze. Under direct light, opaque. When rear lite, chill haze.
Head: Average (Maximum 3.5 cm, aggressive center pour), champagne, high density, quickly diminishing to a 0.5 mm broken ring of bubbles with no cap. 
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.5 – Weak cherries and oak. No yeast, no hops. No ethanol (7.75 % ABV according to the label). 
Flavor – 4.5 – Cherry, slightly sour with some tannin. No yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. No ethanol flavor but pleasant gastric warming. 
Palate – 4.5 – Medium; watery; lively but soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Another excellent brew from RR. Their combo of pediococcus, lactobacillus, brettanomyces and saccharomyces species yields a great tasting mixture of organic acids and other metabolic end products although as the temperature rises, the tannin begins to dominate. Still, quite good!","Jun 23, 2023"
Supplication,,Washington,3.73/5,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 020823 (barrel aged 9 to 15 months, pinor noir barrels, with cherries). Served in my new stemless CBC glass. Brillian ruby color with excellent clarity and little head formation. Mild aroma suggests a bit of tartness. Flavor brings on a LOT of that tartness, approaching outright sour, but has a delicious ripe cherry flavor which complements the Brett nicely. Sharp carbonation is suitable here.

If I was more into sours I might find this outstanding. I find it more drinkable than Cerise Cassée, and I really appreciate the balance here. Unfortunately for me it's a balance between sour Brett and sweet cherries, not so much the oak and the brown ale underneath that I'd be more interested in.","Apr 21, 2023"

Supplication,,Connecticut,4.21/5,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way. 

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated. 

Overall, very interesting and very good beer.","Jun 26, 2022"

O: My 2nd of 3rd RR sours I picked up from SF. This may be their highest rated. Nice brown ale with cherries, almost like a Flander's. Not too tart, which I like. Flavors are nice and clean. Good balance overall.

Beer poured a pretty raspberry with a smallish white head that dissipated pretty quickly.

Nose is nice, berry forward, nice bouquet.

Taste is really well done; a substantial but light malt base combines nicely with the pinot noir barrel which lends the dark berry fruit flavor and a touch of tartness. The introduced Brett lends some funkiness. It finishes with a dry oak barrel.

Mouthfeel i s light bodied and very easy to sip.

Overall even thought my funky sour pallet is underdeveloped i can see this is a really well made beer as it is so flavorful and light and not overwhelming. Buy this if you like the style!","Apr 26, 2022"

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer

Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum

It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it

This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!","Mar 27, 2022"

Russian River Brewing
Date: 21 November 2019
I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. 
When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness. 
The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness. 
The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish. 
This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!","Oct 16, 2021"

I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite.","Apr 10, 2021"
Supplication,,California,4.88/5,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right? 

Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable.

Supplication,,Washington,4.35/5,"Poured from cellar temp on 3/7/2021 bottle dare 8/25/2015 

Pours a reddish amber with a cream colored head that leaves a ring of lacing. 

Nose of red wine, subtle candied cherry, caramel, mild grain, mild oxidation. 

Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer. 

Feel is light with light carb and lingers on the pallet for medium length.

Supplication,,Maine,4.4/5,"375ml bottle - dated 121218 - poured into a classic tulip at 48°F. 

Cork immediately pushes upward as the cage is loosened, abd as I let go, it hurts out with a huge, forceful percussive *POP!* - flying several yards away. Some cork rot is visible.

Pours a clear ruddy deep reddish copper-brown hue, topped woth a finger of coarse pinkish-brown head that quickly reduces to a thin collar, fed by streams of effervescence climbing the glass walls. 

Nose: Absolutely stunning right from the start. Bold, intense aromas of lightly toasted grains bringing a gentle caramel sweetness, big musty cherry that has begun to lose its battle with age, warm, fruity red wine notes, with just enough oxidation to lend some sherry and brandy characteristics, and a panoply of stewed dark fruits. There is a present, but balanced brettanomyces influence, lending the perfect amount of musty funk, forest floor, dusty cellar, petrichor, and this sort of morning-on-the-lake aroma. and it's all held together by a splintery oaken halo, which provides some leather, varnish, and old parchment. Beautiful.

Palate: Supplication greets the palate drier than the aroma would lead one to believe. The grain peeks through just a touch, with a hint of dustiness, while the cherries, with all their sugars fermented out step up with big funky, mushy skin and pit notes. Interestingly, the wine character lacks all fruitiness, and reveals itself with dry, tannic, soaked cask notes. As it opens up, a plummy dark fruit note emerges midpalate. Acidity is mild to moderate, with a quick twinge upfront, and quickly extinguished by the dry, tannic, splintery white oak. There's plenty of musty, dusty brett funk, reminiscent of overripe apricot pits, but there's also this subtle earthy, almost mold-like funk that may very well be from cork rot. The finish is exceedingly dry, with plentiful woody oak. 

Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is light to medium-bodied, bright, snappy, and exceedingly crisp for nearly 8% ABV. The grains to lend some soft texture, and the fruit addition, while dry, does lend additional body. Effervescence is lively, zippy, and foams up over the palate. Tannic and drying. 

Overall: This is a very nice, classic fruited wild ale. I love the jammy stuff as much as the next person, but there's something beautifully rustic and raw about these ones. Every ounce of sugar has been fermented out, leaving a seriously musty, funky, fermented cherry flavour, relying on that touch of grain to give it body. The funk is very earthy, but plays well with the cherry, and the wine translates as mature, funky, wet oak - and lots of it. The subtle plummy notes are tasteful, and it all comes together to show the ale's depth and character. A fantastic offering.","Sep 06, 2020"
Supplication,,California,4.16/5,"L: Clear bold burgundy color with a one finger breath lace that quickly dissipates to only a thin line of lace that clings to the sides of class.

S: Mild sour funk with hints of sour cherry, oak, bananas, and raisins. 

T: Funky sour cherries tempered by the taste of Pinot Noir and oak. The longer it airs the milder and sweeter it gets. 

F: Mild tartness that leaves your mouth watering for more.

O: In a nutshell, a Belgium brown ale with the taste of a wild ale, but the wild ale is tempered and it’s complexity enhanced with the aging in the wine barrels. Brilliant!","Aug 24, 2020"
Sip Of Sunshine,,Colorado,4.44/5,"Had on tap at 1914 house Niwot 

On arrival nearly 2 fingers of bright white head sat on top of a clear, deep, but still pale, golden body. Sparse fine lacing is left.

Aroma is floral, fruity, and piney, immediately with big hop notes, backed up by a nice soft sweet pale malt. Very appealing and comes off as refreshing.

Taste is bitter, but less so than expected. The hops are piney, earthy, and slightly sweet and fruity, with a grapefruit pith bitterness in the finish that is again balanced by a mellow honey sweet pale malt. There is a definite citrus brightness but that isn't the main thing here.

Feel is super drinkable and even dry. This is damn refreshing for the ABV

Overall this is super solid, and in my opinion a benchmark of the ""modern"" WCIPA. Not a product of the IBU wars but still true to some of the original American hop flavors. Not a Juicy/hazy IPA.",Tuesday at 12:52 PM

A: relatively clear straw gold with a nice thick head that dissipates to a wispy collar and a few islands of thin clouds.

S: Tropical fruit and some lemongrass hints. No strong malts to speak of.

M: smooth and slick with a good bit of dryness then a slick finish.

Bright, golden yellow with a brighter, white head of sticky foam.
Good staying power and lacing.
Aroma is clean and softly sweet, hints of lemon and sugar dusted pineapple, this beer smiles and invites you in politely.
Flavor is balanced mix of lager-like malt and white pepper hop bite.
Long and mellow hop character in balance with the mild sweet roll flavors and stewed fruit notes with just a hint of alcohol.
Clean, balanced and well made is the best way to describe this very session-able but slightly boring big beer.","Jun 15, 2023"
Sip Of Sunshine,,Texas,4.51/5,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden amber color with a one finger head of white foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time and leaving a moderate sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is very strong of a sweet grapefruit and tangerine smell mixed with notes of papaya and some herb. There is also a rather strong peach and apricot smell, mixed with some lighter smells of pear and biscuit malt.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice smooth tangerine and bready malt flavor mixed with the grapefruit hop that was in the nose. There is a touch of herbal and pine hop at the start as well, but these are very light in comparison to the grapefruit hop flavor. Other flavors of a light honeydew melon and a decent showing of mango and papaya are there as well, with the ladder fruit getting more intense as the taste advances. A light floral hop and a bit of grain develop at the very end, leaving one with a smooth and rather citrus strong taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the lighter and thinner side for a 8 % abv brew, with a moderate carbonation. For the big citrus and fruit flavors the feel is quite nice, making for a nice and dangerously easy sipper.
Overall – A very pleasant drinking, citrus forward, and highly flavorful IPA. A quite well crafted and very tasty brew.","Jun 14, 2023"
Sip Of Sunshine,,Washington,4.4/5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium to dark coppery amber with a three finger off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and tropical fruit hops, orange, pineapple and mixed tropical fruit and a little pine. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus, tropical fruit an piney hops, grapefruit and orange rind, pine needles, mild mixed tropical fruit and some dankness. A somewhat different piney and citrus rind flavor develops in the finish with great aggressive bitterness. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I guess with the market domination of hazy NE style IPAs out here in the West, I kinda thought the East Coast would be a wasteland of hazies. I've been lucky enough to get several fine IPAs from out East and I'm now convinced that good old non-hazies are available there too. This is a fine example. Not quite a West Coast profile, but lots of the citrus and pine I crave. Lots of herbal hop flavor. I am especially happy about the flavor change about mid-taste, where strong pine takes over from the citrus and fruit, but a somewhat different, mixed fruit note is revealed behind the almost resinous pine. Appropriately named,this is a bright, cheerful IPA I'd love to drink again.","Jun 08, 2023"

Sip Of Sunshine,,Florida,4.39/5,Classic IPA. One of the best you will ever have.,"May 20, 2023"
Sip Of Sunshine,,Pennsylvania,4.66/5,"It starts off with a troubling stark white foamy pour that empties the contents of a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. The foam recedes quickly, unevenly and without any lacing. But expectations were already running high, as the aroma was spot on IPA from the crack of the can. With a liquid golden-amber in color and moderately bright and opaque, all does not seem lost, just because of some extraneous foam. True, this seems to be no less than an ideal combination of complexly sweet and body building malty backbone and hops that transition from tropical fruit to piney dryness at the finish. After the foamy pour receded, there's even some decent glass lacing. Rich, hoppy, smooth and complex, with an ABV of 8% only contributing as an extra attribute to the taste, this is world class.","May 07, 2023"
Sip Of Sunshine,,New York,4.08/5,"On draft in northern New York. Crystal clear golden bronze, not a speck of haze. Served with a .5 inch head that stuck around and good lacing. Have had many times before, first time rating. Solid beer..","May 06, 2023"
Sip Of Sunshine,,Virginia,3.13/5,"The can says that the size of this is ""19.2 FL. OZ""

From the bottom of the can: ""PKG 11APR23 07:50:13""

Appearance: It has a golden-amber colored body with good clarity. There is a slight bit of haze but the beer looks free of any debris. The head starts out large and white but fades out slowly to a creamy textured cap. It has small continents of lacing on the glass.

Aroma: There is an aroma of pine and alcohol. The alcohol aroma becomes even stronger as the nose pulls away from the glass and the pine fades out.

Taste: Up front there is a bit of toffee with some caramel and a mellow lime flavor. The middle of the palate has a strong alcohol flavor with a bit of pine. The back of the mouth has more alcohol flavor and some bitter pine. There is a bit of a bandaid flavor in the aftertaste with a strong pine character, some lime, and some menthol. As a whole it just barely hits the average rank here.

Mouthfeel: Bitterness is high which is very good. The beer has a medium-light body with a resinous slickness. The can states that this has ""ALC. 8% BY VOL."" and the alcohol is present but the high bitterness does a good job of drawing attention away from it. It feels like it should have a much higher ABV given how apparent it is in this beer. The bitterness of the beer really takes the cake here.

Overall: It's a very weird beer that drinks a lot more like a Double IPA even though the can states ""IPA INDIA PALE ALE."" It's also a beer that kind-of grows on you the more that it is consumed. There is a bit of a bandaid character which is a detractor but there is also a high alcohol flavor. Given that it is 8% ABV it's not a huge problem but there are other beers that boast larger ABVs on the market which show less in the beer. The high bitterness is nice and the lime which accompanies the pine is very pleasant. 

I doubt I would buy this beer regularly but I might drink it again in the future. It isn't one I would jump to recommend but people might find it enjoyable. It is a beer where you have to weigh the pros and cons. If you don't mind the overt presence of alcohol and some bandaid off-flavors, you will be rewarded with a strong bitterness and pine.","May 05, 2023"

L: Pours a deep golden with a translucent haze in the glass. Fluffy, off-white head of 3 fingers lasts through the session and leaves beautiful lacing.

S: Smells of tropical fruit, citrus, dank hops, and sweet bread malt.

T: Flavors follow the nose, but are incredibly well balanced. The malt and hops do not try to outshine each other, but instead play together in such a way that it excites the tastebuds. It finishes clean, especially for a DIPA. This must truly be what a sip of sunshine would taste like.

F: Nice level of carbonation, extremely smooth and finishes clean. Incredibly drinkable for a session. Just be careful with DIPAs with this level of drinkability.

If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style.

Keene Idea,,Australia,4.28/5,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net. 

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes. 

In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

Keene Idea,,Massachusetts,4.54/5,"Can from last week's release. Been after this beer for a long time. 

Appearance - It was extremely clean and clear like filtered apple juice. Copper in color which I find to be typical of a west coast IPA. Minimal head that dissipated quick. 

Aroma - Not much going on here. Very muted. Get a little bit of hop aroma but you really have to dig and get your nose in there to find it. Wish it was more pungent.

Flavor - This is where the beer shines for me. Extremely balanced. Malt and hops are in perfect harmony here. No malt sweetness. It's very clean drinking with great balance and a nice subtle hop bite on the end. 

Feel - Super light bodied for a 8.88% double ipa. Drinks like a lager almost. Carb was champagne like with lots of tiny bubbles. Maybe that contributes to the light body. I feel like I could drink quite a few of these no problem. 

Overall - Excellent balance and flavor in this. One of the cleanest and most drinkable WC double IPAs I've had. Would like more aroma but overall this beer is excellent.","Nov 13, 2020"

Keene Idea,,Illinois,4.33/5,"16oz can, dated 08.05.19, poured into a 14oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 08.25.19, reviewed from Tasting Journal.

The beer pours a super hazy orange color, amber hues, super turbid with a foamy finger of white head that has minimal retention but decent lacing. The aroma is very nice, crazy dank and grassy, raw green hop leaf, hop spice, lots of piney resin and some herbal tea brings forward a more floral and citrusy character, tons of bitter grapefruit peel with a bit of underlying tropical fruit and soft pale dough. The flavors are in line with the nose, toeing the line between dank and juicy, grassy, raw green hop, light spice, resinous pine, pineapple, citrus peel, mango and peach with a bit of warming booze and soft dough. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick with a heavier body that's lively and punchy and finishes with a warm and dry boozy finish. 

Verdict: A super good IIPA from Alpine. It's big, it's intense, it's about as hoppy as one can get but that 8.88% ABV is definitely there. Definitely a top IPA from Alpine, who already have a great lineup of worthy beers.","Oct 27, 2019"

Beatification,,Washington,4.17/5,"Sent my way as return fire by @Beersnake1 during NBS BIF#16.

Pours a pure golden yellow that's mostly clear, but I wouldn't describe as crisp. The colour, actually, isn't far off from a slightly lighter version of the label. Wet bubbles rise through the liquid, but there's no head, and thus nothing to retain nor leave lacing. 

Nose is bright and inviting. Starts off much more on the fruity side rather than the truly funky side (we're getting there, though, don't worry!) with some apple, and like meyer lemon. The apple transitions to a mustiness that gives rise to thoughts of wood, and carries us over to the earthier funkier side with light elements of barnyard and just a kind of tart element. 

Flavour is awash with an interesting lead in that I want to give credit again to that meyer lemon-type flavour, then bits of crabapple and wood giving way to the earthy funk again, which presents in a really interesting way that I can only think to describe as, 'open.' I don't know how that works, but where a lot of funky wild ales like this feel tight, compressed, bound up tartness, this feels like the pages spread wide and a more easygoing (but no less pronounced) welcoming earthy funk. The lemon and the funk kind of build together to a pinnacle about 2/3 of the way through that is more in the horse blanket realm and borders on harsh, though the rest of it feels aggressively tart, but in a welcoming manner. The back end takes elements from all of the above, along with a little bit of bleu cheese and faint honey to leave a tart dry finish. 

Very fine carbonation sits atop a decidedly funky/tart beer, but one that I wouldn't describe as sharp. 

I've had several in the -ation series, and they've all been top notch. This is no exception. Thanks, Tim for sending this along my direction!!","May 29, 2023"

Beatification,,California,4.79/5,"Had this on draft at a place with one of the early RRBC accounts in my area. It brought me back to my first pilgrimage to RRBC in Santa Rosa at the 4th Street location. I thought I was there for the IPAs but a family member ran into someone they knew with a goblet of another RRBC barrel-aged product who said ""I don't even like beer but I love this!"" I ordered my own goblets and was introduced to the loveliness of Sanctification and Consecration.

So began my love affair with RRBC barrel-aged stuff. The 100th percentile score is well-earned. This is a delicious sour, which offers common ground to people who normally will not drink sours. The more sophisticated reviews for this will fill in all the notes of stonefruit and granny smith apple stuff that my review lacks; all I have to say is, in the same way that you could serve PtE to someone who would never touch a DIPA with a ten-foot pole, a goblet of this can evangelize regular folks with unsophisticated palates like mine to appreciate the wonder of wild ales and sours made by skilled people.","May 23, 2023"

Beatification,,Washington,4.21/5,"Poured from 375mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Bottled 1/25/22, so it's got a solid year under its belt.

Appearance: lovely light-golden hue with a little tiny bit of haze and a finger of frothy white foam atop. Looks nice.

Smell: soft malt with a light sourness and just enough sweetness to give a light, candylike aroma. Enticing indeed.

Taste: tarter than the aroma would suggest, but with just enough sweetness to be balanced. The sour isn't super sharp, it has some softening around the edges. This is quite an enjoyable beer.

Mouthfeel: medium-rich body with a decent carbonation and a nice creaminess. It has both more body and less carbonation than I usually expect from a bottle-conditioned beer.

Lived up to the hype for me.
Excellent wild ale/geuze. Wonderfully soft and well rounded. Nose and flavor both spot on. Plenty of tart green apple; grassy straw like funk; oaked white wine; gentle but clearly tart. Beer still seemed fairly young at 2+ years; still bright and fresh, not preceded by over barreling.
Enjoyed with meal. Went well with roasted Turkey, roasted butter nut squash and herbed rolls.

Beatification,,Missouri,4.3/5,"Pours a beautiful gold with a clear transparency. No head formation. Aroma is green grapes, chardonnay, slight red grapes, cellar stone, grass, and mild oak. It has a light lactic twist at the front that is quickly soothed out. Acidity is mild. Flavor profile presents a clean arrangement of green grapes, chardonnay, pinot noir, cellar stone, and oak. It's slick, smoothly bouncing between each note. Mild grassy and zesty hops add a little further texture. Sourness and acidity is minor. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a glassy, still texture. Overall, a refreshing wild ale that melds into wine notes well. Easy drinking and not forceful or brash, making for a more tasteful sipping experience.

O: My 3rd “-ation” sour from RR. Either I’m just not into this American-style wild ale, or these are overhyped, but I just haven’t been blown away by these sours. They’re good, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think I’d seek them out again. More sour than tart, quite dry on the finish. Lacking in any true funky flavor or character.

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales, we have the 9th highest rated of the style, and 104th overall. It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one, so I’m interested to see if that holds true. Let’s find out

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head, just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing

Less than stellar looks aside, this one smells fantastic. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, white wine vinegar, acidic lemon juice, sharp oak, crackery malt, lime zest, white pepper, leather, and musty apple skin

Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart, but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, straw, lemon zest, old wood, white grape, and flowers. The swallow brings notes of white pepper, wet hay, old leather, apple skin, white wine vinegar, and light bready malt. Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma

A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation, resulting in a crisp and funky beer. Finishes very dry with a slight tartness

This is good, but I suspect that, for some reason, 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much. Seems odd for a Lambic-inspired beer, but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite. I'd love to try it fresh one day though","Mar 20, 2022"

Beer poured a cloudy golden with a little head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is very nice, very funky and horse blanket forward, along with some acidic vinegar qualities, true to the style.

Taste is a light malt base that has some lemon and apple. The funk, horse blanket, and touch of vinegar blend in very nicely without overwhelming the palate. Finishes tart.

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Tart citrusy taste.

I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles. 
Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal. 

The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor. 

The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright. 

The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish. 

The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again.","Jun 15, 2021"
Beatification,,Colorado,3.62/5,"Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100.

375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20.

""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV.

HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds.

BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look.

I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance.

AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria.

I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present.

Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile.

I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it.

Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body.

Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like.

Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops.

I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above.

OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less.

I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me.

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Connecticut,4.46/5,"2018 vintage; consumed on 5/22/2023

Pours a jet-mahogany body topped with two fingers of fluffy, khaki-hued foam; good head retention leaves a spotty, paper-thin cap, large, creamy collar, and a modest array of chunky, webby lacing strewn around the walls of the glass.

Aromas open to fresh prune laden with prickly oak as accents of fig wash through an encroaching bourbon undercurrent sporting progressive dark cocoa and edgy vanillins detailing.

Taste brings saucy prune and stewed dates upfront, with notes of dusty cocoa and charry oak encroaching on Werthers Originals past the mid-palate into smoked toffee meeting distant undertones of burnt vanilla on the back end of the profile.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and a robust fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing an airy char to a steadily cleaning roast washing over the mid-palate, a quiet warmth trailing into a bright twang integrating effortlessly toward the finish.

A daring fusion of barrel and brightness in a profile saturated with near-syrupy dark fruit reductions and a tempering, deft level of cocoa char; an exceedingly bold, almost authoritative expression of the style executed with adept clarity.","May 23, 2023"

Name: 4th Dementia
Brewery: Kuhnhenn Brewing
Location: Warren MI
Style: Old Ale
ABV: 13.5%
Date: 2022
Next on the review desk is Fourth Dementia from Kuhnhenn Brewing. I am going to start to pull some big ones from the cellar. This beer has been on my want list for over eight years. Many beers on my want list, like Fox Farms, require travel. I am excited to get to this review. Using a tulip, I served this beer at around 50 degrees. The pour created an airy, fingered light brown head with no retention. It came and went faster than life. No lacing was left on the glass. The high alcohol content could cause the head to wane. I was charting the color somewhere around SRM 32, dark rusty brown. The appearance is about average for this style. 
Nosing the glass, I smell whiskey, oak, caramel, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, mild coffee, bread, raisins, smokiness, Maillard, vanilla, char, and tobacco. 
The first sip is like a perfectly executed tango on my palate with flavor. I taste whiskey, oak, caramel, toffee, chocolate, soy sauce, mild coffee, bready, raisins, figs, vanilla, Maillard, tobacco, char, dark roasted malts, burnt sugar, and an aged wine note. 
The mouthfeel is slightly warm and coating, finishing smooth and long. 
This beer is smacking. The wait was worth it; everything about this beer is terrific. The barrel age is near perfect. The warmer the beer gets, the more flavors develop, creating this symphony in your mouth. Stellar beer; I wish I had several more to sip on.","May 07, 2023"

I knew downloading Tavour would be a good idea, and I am very grateful that it allows me to access this long time want of mine. I’ve only had one other Kuhnhenn beer before, the best in style Raspberry Eisbock that I enjoyed very much. This one is yet another highly regarded style topper. Let’s dig in

Pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, this is huge in the nose. Super malty and bourbon forward. I’m picking up on aromas of brown bread, toasted walnut, sweet bourbon, dates, smooth oak, sticky caramel, raisin, brown sugar, smoky tobacco, light aged hops, and sweet red wine

It doesn’t reach the same levels of intensity in taste, but it is still very good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting brown sugar, dark bread, raisin, black cherry, sweet bourbon, caramel, smooth oak, light vanilla, and old leather. The swallow brings notes of brown bread, molasses, toasted walnut, brown sugar, sweet bourbon, burnt caramel, toasted oak, port wine, smoky tobacco, and light sherry

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes off dry with just a touch of booze, feeling well before 13.5%

This is absolutely awesome! I’m so happy I finally got the chance to try it, and even happier I have 3 more bottles of this to drink","May 03, 2023"

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,District of Columbia,4.54/5,"Purchased at the brewery outside of Detroit, MI. 12 oz @ 13.5%. Bought this beer on a Monday at the brewery transported it home stuffed in my steel-toed boot in my luggage on a flight back to DC. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip. I drank this beer on the following Friday evening at home to celebrate my first day in the new office. Very happy I did not wait.

This is the first barrel-aged old ale that I’ve had. A barrel-aged beer that the brewer “did right.” But I still may have taken this beer out of the barrels earlier. The high ABV and the sweetness might make you think you are drinking a barleywine.

Complex is an understatement. 4.5

A – Pours a hazy deep reddish brown but opaque in the glass with a thin tan head with reddish highlights. Constant thin head. Good carbonation. Viscosity on the glass. Some lacing. 4.5

S – A rich but oxidized aroma of vanilla and caramel, with some slight metallic. 4.25

T – Caramel, brown sugar, then the vanilla with finally the barrel spirits in the background. Not as much barrel in the taste as the aroma might lead you to believe. The oxidized or metallic notes are very sedate. Vinous qualities as wells, some raisins soaked in bourbon. No hoppiness that I can discern. 4.75

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,California,4.43/5,"12 oz bottle, 2018 vintage, cellar treat, sent from Junior, into a Prairie Rastal glass. 

This marvelous beer pours a wonderful raisin color with a harvest gold head of 1/4 finger. Recedes to a polite fingernail and stays. Swirling leaves a few micro legs.

Aroma is that of a really settled-in beer. Like this one has had some time to really develop and mature into what it is. Tons of wonderful aged dates and raisins, with shoe leather, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and fig. Hints of chocolate, and a nice hot alcohol aroma envelopes the whole thing. 

Toffee and raisins start this one off, followed by a burnt char note and some piney hop, and then the sweetness returns with caramel and sticky fig, some paper/cardboard, and then fades out on tobacco and molasses. Very complex. A bit sharp and bitter, I'd prefer a little more smoothness, but this flavor profile is bonkers. 

Feel is sticky all the way to the bank with heat throughout but a cooling center. Moderate buzzing carbonation paired with warming alcohol that coats the gums and tongue. Leaves a bit of resin on the finish. 

Overall, this is a really wonderful barrel aged old ale and one I'd try to find again. I do believe I liked their BA stout better, but this is absolutely no slouch.

Aggressive pour yields a small flare of off tan head that recedes pretty immediately. Body is murky raisin brown. 

Nose brings forth the classic notes of leather and raisin and wood and a faint hint of spice. Surprisingly mellow. 

Rich body with notes of milk chocolate and tobacco and spice and sweet vanilla and marshmallow char. As it warms more of the middle range 'old ale' characteristics come forth with leather and toffee and more of an emphasis back on the tobacco. 

This is every bit of 13.5%, but it's not overwhelming or harsh. Rich and spicy and boozy it's definitely a sipper. Starts off a bit sweet, but as it warms that becomes less pronounced and the other stuff moves more into the forefront.

Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Michigan,4.09/5,"2018 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Served at 49 degrees. 

Pour: deep, deep black. 1-2 finger tan head. Recess into a thick, bubbly ring with plenty of clouds and decent lacing. 

Nose: not real strong for me but I’m fighting a cold... Sweet roasted malt, marshmallow (power of suggestion, but accurate), bourbon. Some dark fruit. 

Taste: really unique. Sweet, but malt or molasses sweet not sugary. Caramel/toffee definitely present. Some coffee/deep roasted malt bitterness balancing the sweetness. Rich milk/dark chocolate mix backing up everything. Bourbon is surprisngly mild. Slight lactose taste/feel. 

Mouthfeel: moderate carbonation at first but quickly turns to a milkshake, oily, pillowy feel that is wonderful. Pretty clean finish considering the viscous nature. 

Overall: this is my first and I love the look and feel. Nose is ok, taste is really good but I’m not sure if it’s great for me. Lactose taste isn’t my favorite and I get that, at least for the first bottle. Will revisit review on second bottle and after aging.","Dec 27, 2018"
Citra,,,4.6/5,"The first Citra was incredible. We found that bottle aging for ten days smoothed it out.
After a few years of substandard Citra hops resulting in a brew not as good as the first, it's back up to where it was in the beginning.
Since KRBC switched to all aluminum cans, the mouth feel is less wonderful than from a bottle.
It's best at the brewery. 
The food?
I go to drink, not to eat. The waffle fries are flavored soggy cardboard.","Jun 25, 2023"

Citra,,Pennsylvania,4.46/5,"Citra from Kern River Brewing, 16 fl oz can from @2beerdogs in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 25/04/23 (Review 3082). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Lower rim of can stamped “CANNED ON 0?/2?/23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 45.3 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Pale Straw (SRM 2), clear.
Body – Pale Gold (SRM 4), hazy. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, translucent.
Head: Large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive center pour), ivory, high density, average retention, rapidly retreating, leaving a 1.2 – 2.2 cm jagged crown and a rocky complete layer. As the head contracts, irregular elongated islands remain above the head.
Lacing – Good – remnants of the head following the patterns of the head, but thinner.
Aroma – 4.5 – Grapefruit and generic citrus (tending toward pineapple) backed by caramel malt, no yeast. No ethanol (8.5 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – Follows the nose. Begins and ends citrusy and full-bodied, a bit dank and resinous over caramel malt. No yeast or ethanol. Barely noticeable gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends crisp and dry with a little resin.
Palate – 4.25 – Full; dry; lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 Good DIPA – dank, crisp, and citrusy.","Apr 25, 2023"
Citra,,Illinois,4.58/5,"The smell is just unreal and this one is not for a first time IPA drinker. What a treat, and I hope they continue to expand with their distribution.

Citra,,Texas,4.51/5,"Citra pours a slightly hazy, cloudy amber color with a big beautiful head. A sixteen ounce, canned 11/24/22 is very strong with the Citra aroma. Taste is powerful and good. Citra and Amarillo go together well in this brew. Fabulously smooth and not really bitter at all. Overall a fine Double IPA.","Dec 24, 2022"
Citra,,Washington,4.35/5,"Both @2beerdogs and @Beersnake1 sent me cans of this one related to the recent NBS BIF#16, so I guess the California contingent feels strongly that I should try it!!

Beautiful clear caramel gold colour with a good finger plus of just off white foam. Soft and velvety with sprinkled large bubbles, it sticks to the glass as it recedes. 

Nose is a great showcase for citra hops, and that works for me, because citra is a great hop! There's some citrus, some pine, some kind of light honeysuckle and wonderful rich complementary caramel malts underneath. 

Flavour isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it presents all the goodies. Bitter citrus and pine, some caramel malts, some round fruits... finish is bitter but not overpowering by any means. It's mostly in the pith/citrus side of things, but not the full on acid bomb of like a Monkish, and it's balanced with a little bit of earthy pine and a touch of the sweet malts to balance.

This is just a phenomenal beer all around, and right up my alley. I love what I've tried from Kern River, and I can see why both Tim and Derek both independently thought I should try this beer. Thanks, fellas!!","Dec 22, 2022"
Citra,,California,4.35/5,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours an opaque yellow with fluffy white head. The nose is tropical fruit, pine needles, marmalade. The taste is incredible. Tropical fruit, orange peel, pine, honey, marmalade, apricot, pineapple, and a bit of leather. Mouthfeel is light and dry. Overall, a wonderful IPA.","Dec 12, 2022"
Citra,,North Carolina,4.35/5,"16 ounce can into plastic hotel room cup at Tustin Inn. Canned on 3/17/22. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some streaming carbonation. Aromas and flavors of huge passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, blueberry, tangerine, red grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, bread dough, light honey/toast, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good sized pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body. Balanced creamy/grainy malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. Long resinous drying finish with mild astringency. Mild increasing warmth of 8.5%, a bit of hop burn. Super juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a good sized malt backbone. Top tier west coast style, aggressive yet smooth.","May 01, 2022"
Citra,,,4.94/5,"Poured a golden amber color with a nice 1 inch head that left some lacing. Taste is exactly what I hoped for—loads of delicious, dank citra! Mouthfeel is nice; has some rich gravity to it. I’m highly considering buying some more of this—very nice, delicious brew. Very strong on the citra hops and leans on the west coast IPA side, thankfully.","Apr 03, 2022"
Citra,,Indiana,4.44/5,"Appearance - The beer poured a rusty yellow color with a visible carbonation and a white head. 

Smell - Citrus came though in the nose with a little bit of sweetness. 

Taste - With a full body, the citra hops needed to be bold. In fact, they were bold. Unlike most citra hopped beers, this one leaned more bitter. It was dank, with notes of guava and lemon. The finish was warm and a bit of spice. 

Mouthfeel - This was not a light beer. It had serious viscosity for the style with notable carbonation. 

Overall - Citra hops went in a bit different direction in this beer. I liked it.","Dec 22, 2021"
Citra,,California,4.18/5,"Sweet tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and hint of piney, citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a balanced, old-school hoppy, slightly malty, and piney citrus bitter finish. This was a little more malt dominant than I was expecting, but still good!","Dec 19, 2021"
Citra,,California,4.29/5,"Gold steering toward brown, white foam.

Face full of citra hops.

Not the east coast fruit bomb, this has a domineering earthy bent. Something close to cumin with more than notes of tangy pineapple and, much more so on the finish, orange.

Dry-ish and sharp-ish, sorta crackery. Notably softer when poured.","Dec 09, 2021"
Citra,,Connecticut,4.4/5,"Canned on 11/11/21; consumed on 11/19/21

Pours a foggy, bronze-tinted, rusty orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a finger of rich, creamy cap, equally rich collar lining the surface, and thick layers of webby lacing and spotty accessories spread across the entirety of the glass.

Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet, whereon transitional pine to fresh-cut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank, lemon twist.

Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith, wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures; a grapefruit twang over the mid-palate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the mid-palate, trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency, and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish.

Levels of resinous saturation bridge West Coast and New England IPA elements, bringing into focus advanced tropical fruit development born from an ultra-refined and raw hop core, and a deftly established malt profile; this is a measured intensity, and a deceptively potent variation of the WCIPA.","Nov 20, 2021"
Citra,,California,4.44/5,"2021 Vintage

Appearance: Slightly cloudy amber-yellow color with a fairly generous generous-sized thick, foamy white head that slowly faded. A nice looking IIPA for my tastes.

Smell: Citrus, tropical fruit aromas and moderate pine aromas. Nothing to fault with the nose.

Taste: Moderately tart grapefruit/citrus notes, moderate tropical fruit notes and mild pine notes. Some mild bready notes from the malts to counter all the hop notes. The beer has a strong hop backbone that provides a fairly dry finish that lets the fruity notes die off gradually.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IIPA.

Overall: A great IIPA. A very good hop flavor profile with enough of a malt backbone to produce a good flavor profile. i wish I had a time machine so that I could decide if OG Nelson or Citra was/is my favorite IPA/IIPA.","Mar 31, 2021"
Citra,,California,4.86/5,"Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!
L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint. 
S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect. 
T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some. 
F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time. 
O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out!","Mar 26, 2021"
Citra,,California,4.74/5,"Points off on looks only because the head is fairly scrawny; much less than a finger in my pint glas;. nice lacing though. I have a lousy nose but as soon as I opened the can I could smell fruity goodness with citrus dominating. The taste is so well balanced, with a good amount of juicy +hoppy. Citrus flavors dominate but certainly only part of a really well balanced flavor profile. I really like this one a lot. More, please.","Jan 15, 2021"

Citra,,California,4.46/5,"Pours a beautiful glowing copper, clear and clean. The aroma isn’t as big and vibrant as I might expect, but more subdued and muted. It’s bursting with flavor, all that citra goodness, with just enough heft and body on the back. I thought it was fantastic.","Dec 15, 2020"
Citra,,Maine,4.5/5,"Huge thanks to Ryan for this can! 

Pint can - canned in mid-November - poured into an Spiegelau IPA glass at 42°F.

Pours a very attractive golden amber-honey hue - just a touch foggy, with a creamy, dense, two-finger eggshell white head with remarkable retention, leaving a thick sticky collar as it recedes. 

Nose: Right there. It smells exactly like a heavily Citra-hopped West Coast double IPA. The malt base is surprisingly pale, with a lovely lightly toasty grain profile, with some sweet, bready crystal malt notes. Citra notes just explode with ripe tangerine, grapefruit, drippy pear, meyer lemon, candied pineapple, mango juice, fresh grass, pine sap, and actual fruit. Like that fruit skin smell you get in the produce aisle. It smells like produce aisle. So fresh and bright. 

Palate: I try to be objective as possible, but sometimes, you take that first sip, and a beer just rocks your world. This is that, for me. The beer greets the palate with this simultaneous punch of perfect malt sweetness, grainy pale malt, mineral water zing, and a big explosion of Citra hops. Lemon zest, grapefruit pulp, Satsuma mandarin and tangerine, and even some key lime zest. There's some wisps of pineapple, mango, and passionfruit, but,it isn't thw tropical cocktail that the nose is. This is a bowl of citrus. There's this raw, green, leafy hop character that I usually only find in Nelson, and that obliterates the malty backbone, reducing it to pale grain. Some resinous Ponderosa pine sap, pithy grapefruit, and leafy green hops set a dry, resinous, moderately bitter tone to the finish which lingers for ages, eventually coming across as pure hop cone. 

Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium-full in body. It has a sturdy backbone, but it doesn't overtake the beer, and it remains fully drinkable, and even quite crisp. You could drink this on a hot summer day and not feel like you're choking back a big beer. Very minimal malt stickiness, and a nice oily resinous hop cling that just adheres to the palate. Effervescence is so beautifully lively and zippy. Fully dry finish. 

Overall: I hate that I'm doing this, but this ia a 4.5 across the board. I almost never review a beer that gets the same score for every category, but I can't honestly rate this any other way. This is a truly unique and incredible West Coast DIPA. It's saturated with intense citrus on the nose, with a huge punch of Citra flavour balanced by a perfect malt base, beautiful minerality, the prime level of bitterness, AND it's refreshing? Come on, what more can you want from this? What a gem. It's beers like this that make me excited about IPAs. Seek this out.","Dec 09, 2020"
Citra,,Washington,4.21/5,"L: A darker filtered orange with an sizable ivory head settling down to a wisp and a wide band that climbs the glass and leaves a couple narrow partial bands of lace.

S: Malt Bomb, medicinal pine, and citrus syrup.

T: Follows the nose, there’s an unexpected clove note in there too. Pretty strong. Bitter And resinous like the West coast doubles of old.

F: Heavier weight, malty and sticky and a good stomach full. Right carbonation. Off-dry with a drier and bitter finish.

O: If you like’em malty this is well done. Overall I personally would not put it at number five however. A bit of hype.","Jun 19, 2020"

S: Sweet fragrance of passion fruit and oranges.

F: Medium bodied with a dry finish

Consumed 12/26/22

I was surprised to see that Trillium did a Xmas drop in the Chicagoland area of fresh hazy beers, so I grabbed some as soon as I could for my holiday week. I find that when someone can do a lower abv (6.6%) with a lot of flavor that that is more an achievement than knocking out a DIPA. My pallet generally goes toward liking the higher abvs, but I need the lower one once in awhile when having more than one beer in a sitting. I am loving the balance in bitterness here more than anything. The Midwest brewers love to land on the sweeter side, but I actually like the dryer bitter finishes more. The beer does lack quite a bit on the nose as I am not getting much beyond some citrusy hop notes buried deep. The feel is full and smooth. Overall a great beer. I wish I had a fresh Zombie Dust to compare to see which would win for me.","Dec 26, 2022"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,,Pennsylvania,4.27/5,"Nice light fluffy pale ale. I love this line of pale ales in general, with the DDH being the best variant. Maybe due to having the DDH version first, I really expected too much of this. Full disclosure, this is very good. One of the best pale ales I've had, and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller ABV, and I do love galaxy hops - but this doesn't stand up to the DDH Fort Point.","Aug 01, 2022"

Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,,Massachusetts,4.33/5,"Looks and smells gorgeous. Lots of citrus and tropical flavors on the nose. The mouthfeel is also good though the taste flavors are more on the grapefruit than citrus side. Personally, I liked it because it does make for a more balanced and complex beer. 

I was happy to have this over sunset at a brewery. It just lacked something to make it a memorable beer. The dry hopping with Galaxy was pretty good but could be better. You could tell that the base beer (Fort Point) was awesome and saved the day.","Oct 26, 2020"

T: Mild bitterness, big juicy hop flavors of tropical fruit, peach, and pine. The malt has a candylike flavor that reinforces the hop flavors.

F: Medium/full body, lowish carb, very Lush.

Overall: A really good beer that is just a little short of being great due to some off notes from the hops. I get a bit of staleness that is not due to the beers age (canned two weeks ago), but other than that it is really great.","Oct 18, 2020"

Overall really excellent. Glad I could pick some up!

I don't always knock points for style guidelines but I did here. Sure it's great and that's how they do things at Trillium but I like pale ales to be clear and crisp.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,,Missouri,4.39/5,"Pours a mango-orange with a murky transparency and a finger of white foam that retains well. Aroma is earthy papaya, tangerine and grapefruit with a little stone and yeast beyond. It's tropical fruit opening lingers for a while, letting the base pale ale (which is already very hoppy) show throw in fragments. Aroma is akin to a very powerful NE IPA. Flavor profile is papaya, tangerine, mango, tangerine with a little earthy, nutty malt and raw grain and yeast to sooth things out. It's tropical fruit through and through, and drinks very similar - identical - to Trillium's Northeast IPA (this is labeled as an American Pale Ale at the time of review). All this to say, it's incredible hop forward, much more so than other pale ales, which may be a deterrent for some. Mouth feel is a little gritty, silty and soft, with a medium-thick consistency. It's liken to a well-worn lumpy, linen pillow. Overall, despite a slightly misleading style, the name of the beer lets those knowledgeable about beer that the hop content is going to be high, thus I will not knock it for the style mis-interpretation. It's big and flavorful, which is welcome in a beer. It combines well with the lightly gritty texture to develop a refined, but well-worn and knowledgeable, experience.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,,Connecticut,4.57/5,"Classic hazy, opaque, and nearly pulpy New England look; mango-orange body. Strong head production, with about a finger and a half of off-white foam from a gentle pour. Retention is solid.

Aroma is just bursting with hops: bright herbs (mint, oregano, basil), waves of citrus (mandarin orange, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit), tropical fruit (melon, mango, strawberry, peach), and a honey cracker malt base beneath it all.

Brew delivers the same character to the palate. There's a chewy, grainy, crackery malt bill in the background, reminding you this is an APA, while still allowing the hop character to shine. Bright, minty herbs; biting citrus; mild pine and resin; and to a lesser prominence, some juicy tropical tones. Flavor profile matches the nose in terms of individual tones. More bitter than you might expect, favoring grapefruit, lemon, and citrus peel a touch more than other fruit.

Quite biting for the New England style, but very appropriate for an APA. Still quite creamy; surprisingly astringent.","Apr 13, 2019"

Feel is very soft and lightly sticky.

4th Anniversary,,Pennsylvania,4.09/5,"Cloudy orange with a fat finger of dense, off-white foam head. Good retention and thick lacing.

Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath.

Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips.

Full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.

Lots of fantastic elements in this. The Playdoh was a huge let down at first, but again, that off-flavor didn’t last too long.","Feb 02, 2022"
4th Anniversary,,Minnesota,4.3/5,"Holy cow was my reaction to seeing this. It poured very thick. Orange color. 2 finger white head. The head retention is amazing, considering the ABV. Beautiful lacing on the glass. 
The nose is well, fairly minimal. Which surprises me. I'm just getting a faint citrus from it. Just a hint of pineapple, and grapefruit. Very minimal. 
Taste - Now the taste is another thing all together from the aroma. This is a VERY hoppy beer. There's just a ton of citrus in it. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange - all there. Tons of hops in the flavor. 
This beer is thick as heck here, which doesn't surprise me one bit. The hops just cling to my throat, and don't let go at all.
While this beer is light in the aroma department, it more than makes up in every other category. Another damn solid beer from Other Half.","Apr 07, 2020"

T: everything carries through in a very impressive way. Juicy and smooth, nearly creamy, with the slightest bit of bite at the end and a tiny hint of alcohol

F: soft, smooth, solid

Tastes a little sweet with a balance of hop bitterness. Ripe papaya, pineapple, herbaceous notes. 
Feels a little thin. Not the full bodied brews I am used to from OH. Medium carbonation

O: Well rounded and impressive. Man, I was late to the game on this one as it’s almost two months old, but if this has ‘fallen off’ at all, I dream of what it was fresh. As it is now, it’s an absolute monster. Full, rich, tropical, and mellifluous. Well done.","Mar 29, 2018"
4th Anniversary,,Connecticut,4.73/5,"L - as I crack the can, the tab slowly disappears into the murk. Pours an incredibly dense, pale, solid brick of dark yellow haze. Most beers you hold up to the light and they get brighter. Not this one. Almost gets darker like it's swallowing up the light. 

S - huge fruity burst on can crack. Loads of ripe pineapple and sticky onions. Definitely some dank here. White grape and vanilla lemon/orange zest. 

T - potent and pungent. Wow. Almost makes my eyes water as the flavor settles on my tongue... and settles... and settles... some serious lasting power here. Up front is forceful peach and lemon creamsicle. Sticky pineapple and green mango. Brief honeydew and lime. Pink grapefruit. Every flavor is packed with biting zest, dank onions, and booze. Razor sharp barbed wire palatables (yeah I'm making up words now; fite me). There might even be some brown sugar on the finish. Sweet like fermented fruit. Finishes grainy and ultimately dry. 

F - yup, there's booze in here. Mealy sugar crystal feel and generally oozes sweet stickiness everywhere. Surprisingly light in feel with minimal carb and a velvety smoothness. Just super sugary. 

O - duality of tranquility and aggression. The peach is the overarching foundation that holds this beer together resulting in a seamlessly smooth brew, but is peppered with onion prickles that really jazz things up. It's an eye opener that'll wake you up.","Mar 23, 2018"
4th Anniversary,,Alabama,4.74/5,"Canned 02/02/18, not sure what stamp says...

Pours a deep hazy gold, with sticky residual lace and a frothy white head of foam.

Sweet and Dank. Pineapple, citrus, slight hints of booze. Balanced, smooth, awesome.

Again, sweet and tropical hit the forefront. Mango, citrus, pineapple, very slight malty hints. A brief numbing booze. I love this.

4th Anniversary,,New York,4.7/5,"Growler from the source.

This one pours a very and milky yellow, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This one smells like ripe and pungent mango and pineapple, with ruby red grapefruit, marijuana, and pine.

This really is exceptional- the hype is warranted. It's so bold and very hoppy, with a heavy bitterness and a big juicy hop flavor. Threre's lots of the pineapple mango, sticky and bright, with pine and marijuana bitterness on the finish. There's absolutely no hint of the booze at all, which is pretty astonishing.

This is medium bodied, creamy and smooth, with a normal level of carbonation.

This beer is everything that makes Other Half great. It's ludicrous, but it's delicious.","Feb 27, 2018"

S - one of the most pungent beers I've come across, cracked the can at arm's length and smelled it immediately, leans tropical, more mango/pineapple than orange, smarties (the candy), hint of that 'green grape skin' I get from galaxy sometimes

T - intense fruit, nicely balanced sweetness, lots of grapefruit, medium-bitter finish like under-ripe mango rind, intense but not abrasive

F - perfect medium plus body, slightly more carb than typical OH, surprisingly little burn for 10%

O - a little over the top, but easily one of the best beers I've ever had","Feb 25, 2018"
4th Anniversary,,New York,4.7/5,"Decanted from a 16 oz (473 ml) can into a conical pint glass; produced 2/2/2018 (GANGSTA - whatever that means). Re-reviewed on a can produced on 2/6/19 (DOGS IN A PILE) on 2/22/19 in a snifter and found it substantively the same as previously described.
A: Pours a cloudy, yet very bright golden color with a two finger, white head, solid retention, and rings and rings of lacing all the way down the glass. On retry, lacing was more soapy.
S: Aromas of peach, mango, pineapple and course grains.
T: Semisweet. Flavor of pineapple predominates over others in the nose with solid bitterness not at all overwhelming, rather beautifully complementing the flavor pallet.
M: Medium bodied with strong carbonation. Creamy and smooth.
O: Really special and really a winner. I am somewhat staggered than this much flavor could be derived from the application of hops. One more home run from Other Half.","Feb 23, 2018"

A: Pours a hazy orange with a finger of sloppy, bright white head. Generous lacing and excellent retention.

A: Quite aromatic. Peach, mango, a bit of pineapple and pink grapefruit. A bit of grassiness. 

T: Mango juice, grapefruit and pith, orange julius, light wheaty graininess, a touch of bitterness which is covered by medium-light sweetness which nicely ties things together. 

M: Medium-full body and medium carbonation which partly cuts the hefty creaminess. 

O: Excellent stuff. The best of the 2nd-4th Anniversary IPAs, which I tasted all within a few days of each other.","Feb 15, 2018"
4th Anniversary,,Massachusetts,4.62/5,"This manages to reach the highest level of hop saturation without being harsh or boozy even at the high abv.

Triple Sunshine,,New York,4.34/5,"Canned 11/08/21. Let sit out for 15 minutes , before opening.

Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center. 

Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma . 

Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade] flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too. Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish, and lingers beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears. 

Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv. Slight drying effect after finish. A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat.

Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version. All-in-all, a pleasant experience, though I prefer normal Sip just a tad more. :)

On the nose, tropical fruit, melon, with hints of pine and dank. On the palate, lots of citrus and tropical fruit balanced by a solid malt backbone. Very full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel due to the moderate carbonation. The high ABV adds a warmness on the finish. This is a sipper that develops nicely as it warms.

Feel... Suck a thick fullness with the carbonation making it not appear sweet in the back. Excellent. 
Overall...This is very good just not the sort i seek out, so my bias is somewhat inherent in the review I suppose. Clearly that bias reflects somewhat in the score but ""Whata You gonna do"".

Honey sweetness, papaya, honeydew melon, some residual resinous bitterness. You can definitely feel the heat which is quite fusel. It's like an underpinning of some vodka or something, so it really has the taste of booze soaked fruit. A bit astringent on the finish.

A more traditional looking golden appearance rather than hazy under a modest, fading white head.

Bold aromas of tropical fruits, citrus, dank, and resinous characters along with toasted bread crust and a hint of booze.

Medium mouthfeel.

Sweet and then those hop characters really jump forward and overtake everything. There is a slight booze burn at the finish and the booze seems a little more notable in the taste. Lingering finish.","Dec 30, 2021"
Triple Sunshine,,Pennsylvania,4.31/5,"12oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/2/21, so just over 3 weeks old.

Faintly hazy deep amber body. The loose bubbly head does not retain at all, hence no lacing. 

Strong tropical fruit aroma.

On tasting, bam!! Big grapefruit, pineapple and other mixed fruit flavors. Solid malt base adds a sweetness. Warming from the abv.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a sweet warm citrus bitterness, grapefruit leading the way.

Overall, while all the parts may not be stellar, the overall effect is very good indeed. It is also dangerously drinkable, so sipper beware.","Dec 25, 2021"

The nose is fragrant and fruity with ripe cantaloupe, pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, and bubblegum. Its taste is big and bold; quite sweet with ripe melon and tropical fruit balanced by lemon, grapefruit rind., and onion. It's super dank and dense in flavor. There is herbal, piney bitterness throughout. I wish the hop bill were more apparent. It's also noticeably boozy. The mouth feel is super plush and thick, almost syrupy, with moderate carbonation, and if anything it drinks bigger than the 10.5% ABV. Overall, Triple Sunshine is a tour de force. To my palate it's sweeter than regular Sip. It's one of the best TIPAs I've had, which isn't surprising coming from Lawson's.","Dec 18, 2021"
Triple Sunshine,,Michigan,4.85/5,"Was able to try this courtesy of Roguer, and now I sort of hate him as I cannot get this on a regular basis. 
Poured in all its unfiltered glory and capped with a soft, bone white 2 finger head.
Aroma was, for a TIPA, remarkably mild and sweet. Honey, I actually smelled honey in this. There were some faint citrus and grassy parts but not at all what I expected. Wonderful smell.
The taste is even better, holy cow I wish this was a crowler as 12oz went by way too quickly. Honey leads and just subtlety wraps up the hops and any malts with smooth gentleness. I think I could drink a gallon of this but for the ABV.
The feel was excellent for the style, so smooth, I could detect no bitterness at all.
So good, so dangerously easy to drink.","Dec 15, 2021"
Triple Sunshine,,Massachusetts,4.24/5,"Drank from a 12 fl oz (355 ml) can purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Canned on: 11/11/21
Served in a tulip

The beer poured a slightly hazy, medium amber hue and was topped by a tight, frothy, finger-tall, bright white crown that fell to a clingy collar. This definitely did not resemble your typical New England IPA. A patchy blanket of drippy lacing coated the glass and stuck around for quite a while.

The aroma was outstanding initially but transformed significantly as the beer warmed. Tropical fruits leapt from the glass. Passionfruit was most apparent. Lots of honey drizzled mango as well. Fairly sweet overall. Citrus fruits were also noticeable. Juicy orange notes came to mind. Bit of tangerine too. As the beer sat, the tropical fruit notes subsided and citrus took over. Later, the passionfruit reappeared.

The flavor profile was quite fruity and sweet. Citrus notes came through strongest. Loads of juicy orange and tangerine flesh. Bit of citrus rind-like pith too. The beer was anchored by a stiff malty backbone. Big pineapple presence in the center. Sugar coated ruby red grapefruit notes appeared on the back end and carried into the finish. Pithy, bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes lingered after the swallow. With time, the sweetness really intensified. 

Excellent creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Lighter bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, fairly zippy effervescence that turned super smooth on the palate. For a 10.5% ABV beer, the alcohol was well hidden.

Although this beer no longer garners the hype that it once did, I can definitely understand its appeal. Triple Sunshine was a nice reminder as to how New England-style IPAs once were.","Dec 14, 2021"
Triple Sunshine,,Colorado,3.65/5,"12 fl oz pull-tab can courtesy of Edms79 - thanks, man!

Currently ranked #8 in the Imperial IPA category and #85 in the top 250 overall beers list - not too shabby!

""Triple IPA."" 10.5% ABV.

Served chilled into a stemmed snifter.

APPEARANCE: Head is quite healthy and robust for a 10.5% ABV ale, easily lasting 8-10 minutes. White in colour with some froth and cream to it...has a good consistency.

Body colour is a vibrant pale copper. Clear enough, and seemingly filtered. Free of yeasty sediment, lees, etc.

It's an appealing appearance for an IIPA, no doubt. 

AROMA: Pineapple, mango, fresh floral hop aromatics, juicy lychee, Mandarin orange slime, maybe a kiss of faint grapefruit. Malts seem to be pale/2-row and maybe caramalt?

Appealing, though it doesn't promise a dazzling hop profile.

TASTE & TEXTURE: I've got to tip my hat to Lawson's; this disguises its 10.5% ABV dangerously well. Slimy lychee and Mandarin orange make an appearance, but aren't accompanied by a slippery mouthfeel; this beer's texture is actually fairly coarse, helping bring out what little grapefruit pith there is without scraping the palate too much.

Perfectly carbonated. Mouthfeel is in the happy medium between wet and dry. It's not refreshing, but cmon - it's 10.5% ABV.

I don't get any pine, lemon-lime, overt orange citrus, onion/garlic, or berry flavours. Mostly, it's a fruity IIPA that doesn't overcommit to the overdone tropical fruit hop profile I expected it to. Pineapple does make an appearance, but it's welcome.

Mouthfeel does accentuate the taste.

It's a well balanced and shockingly drinkable IIPA, sure, but I don't think its hop profile dazzles. Any top rated IIPA is going to invite comparisons to Pliny the Elder, and for my money Russian River's effort is a substantially better beer if only because I like its hop profile more and it boasts better depth of hop flavour...there's no equal here to the pungent pine found in Pliny or the insanity of flavour observed in Bell's Hopslam.

OVERALL: This won't make my personal Top 250, but it's a respectable IIPA with dangerous drinkability and good balance. I'm glad I got to try it, and I think it's a step above something like Lagunitas Sucks, but it doesn't unseat something like Pliny The Elder, Hopslam, or Port's (criminally underregarded) Hop 15 in my book.

Triple Sunshine,,Kiribati,3.49/5,"Thanks to Roguer for this one 12oz can (dated 11/16/21) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a very cloudy, but still barely translucent) burnt orange color a half-inch of white head that had OK retention and very light lace.

Certainly hop forward, mostly fruits but some citrus, with a light grain scent backing up.

The flavors started out similar, fruits at the front, but in the middle and back citrus bite took over, and there was a bit of pine as well. There was just enough malt showing to provide a bit of a counter-point.

The body was bit fuller than medium, mildly coarse, , and a medium-sweet finish.

Leaner,,Missouri,4.45/5,"Pours a dark orange with a foggy transparency. One finger of off-white foam fizzes up top, dissipating quickly. Aroma is tart and abbreviated. It hits peach right up front, but it's soft. Stone, lemongrass, oak, green grapes, and grass all add some depth for a clean, playful smell. Flavor profile is delightful, with sweet peach right out front. Peach is mild, never commanding the lead. Accents of white wine, stone, faint pear, oak, and lemongrass establish the rest of the flavor profile. It starts out tart, leaning into sour at the end. It also finishes with a more acidic bite than the start. Mouth feel has a bubbly start, but soft finish. Thickness is medium. Overall, peach is really pleasant, and compliments the underlying beer well. It posses just enough tartness to tighten up the jaw, but not enough to wreck the palate. 

Served in a 12oz snifter from a 750mL bottle. Batch #2. Reviewed from notes.","Jan 14, 2022"
Leaner,,Colorado,3.97/5,Too acidic and not quite the same 'whole peach' character as the Casey Leaner. Aroma is great I just find the acidity overpowering the sweet peach notes on the palette.,"Jan 11, 2022"
Leaner,,Vermont,4.5/5,"Mega sour. Lacking the funk character of the Casey blend. Overall, this is a good beer, but it needs to be served with a side of Tums. Worth a try if you can get it at cost.","Nov 22, 2021"
Leaner,,Michigan,4.49/5,"Pouted from a 750 mL bottle. The color is very pretty dark yellow/orange hazy color. The aroma is a bit of funk with a big explosion of peaches, love it.

Leaner,,Alabama,4.63/5,"Blend #2.

Beautiful golden hue introduces notes of fresh peaches and subtle oak. The palate bursts with a bright, fruity acidity that paves the way for a lingering sour pucker and a pinch of tannic dryness. So damn good.","Oct 03, 2020"
Leaner,,Wisconsin,4.37/5,"On tap, poured into a stemmed wine glass. Stout white head with good lacing. Nice deep golden color. Funk and peaches on the nose. Tart peaches are up front. Some light acidity towards the end of the sip. Medium body. Nice to finally try this one.","Sep 04, 2019"

Leaner,,Virginia,4.45/5,"Blend #2.

A: Pours a hazy, light orange-tinted gold with a finger of bright white, very fizzy head that fizzles out pretty quickly to a still surface. No lacing.

S: Bursting with barnyard funk, earth, light grainy malt, woody/dry oak, fruity white wine, and just a hint of peach. Well integrated.

T: Bracing moderate sourness transitions to juicy peach, mild earthy funk, medium-light sweetish grainy malt, finishing with a lingering sourness. 

M: Medium-light bodied, mildly creamy, with medium carbonation. 

O: Excellent funky sour beer with light barrel treatment and *very* mild peach component (not unexpected given past experience with peach sours). Great as a naked sour beer, but perhaps less satisfying as a peach sour.","Mar 11, 2019"

Leaner,,Missouri,4.37/5,"3 way split at Side Project cellar. Pours a peachy yellow with small, fluffy white head. Quite cloudy. Smells faintly of peaches, which became more pronounced as it warmed up. Tastes like a stoney peach, with a dry and surprisingly creamy finish. I was glad I got to try this on-site only release, and even happier that 2 other people that I met there were willing to split the cost of the bottle, as the price point is a little steep in my opinion to enjoy by yourself.","Mar 06, 2016"
Leaner,,Missouri,4.45/5,"Caution: contains spoilers...
Love the peachy color, slight cloudiness, and bright white lacing on this one.
Smells oh so fresh and peachy!
The flavor get started just how I want--peach (you're getting the theme), then tart (not too sour, though), then a left turn to a Bazooka Joe bubble gum finish. 
Mouthfeel is perfect.
Overall: I love this beer besides the bubble gum aftertaste. Damn you, Bazooka Joe! But wait, they're about to tap derivation one right now! Huzzah for the Kings!","Feb 23, 2016"
Leaner,,Oregon,4.34/5,"750ml bottle, batch 1, served on site at Side Project Cellar.

Pours a lemon yellow, hazy and cloudy with a one finger thick white head with good retention, a bit of lacing. Smells of a very earthy, sulphuric mineral aroma at first, with a touch of peach. The peaches don't quite jump out at first, but if you let it warm up a bit and swirl it some, the peach aroma will climb out. Minerals, graininess, a bit of acetic presence though not a lot. Mild oak and funk presence. Flavour brings out more overripe peach, a bit of sulfur, mineral, yeast, oak, cereal, saison yeast. Mild funk. The peach is overall subtle compared to some other peach beers, but this does have a bit of that Casey house funk. It's interesting and the acidity is quite restrained compared to what you'd expect from a Side Project beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, good carbonation with an overall enjoyable sipping profile. It didn't blow my socks off, but it's a very nicely executed beer. Soft, delicate without too much acidity, and a fair amount of peach.","Feb 21, 2016"

Medianoche - Coconut,,Ohio,4.37/5,"This is my first time ever having a stout from weldwerks, and it's my first medianoche (I don't even know if they make stouts that aren't in that 'series'). This is really quite good. I'm a coconut fiend, and this doesn't disappoint It's essentially liquid dessert - milk chocolate coconut. To me, it's sweet but not diabetic sweet. It's less sweet than Coconut Vibes (Shared, aka side project), but it's also less coconut forward. Coconut vibes is also liquid milk chocoluate coconut, but it has a noticeable coconut pop. This is so integrated that the coconut is integrated, but not popping. I'd prefer the popping, but this is way easier to drink than that. If I was only going to buy 1, I'd probably buy coconut vibes only because of that noticeable coconut pop. GOD i love coconut.","Jan 23, 2023"
Medianoche - Coconut,,New York,2.28/5,"This one pours a fairly flat looking inky and gloopy looking black color, with no head or lacing.

This smells like pure sugar, cheap melted chocolate milkshake, coconut syrup, and caramel.

This is actually disgusting. This series used to be some of the best barrel aged stouts in the country, but Weldwerks has just gone off the deep end with these. It’s just tastes like sweet stout glue, basically – it’s basically liquified black sugar – it’s basically…you get it, right? It’s just way too sweet and cloying, with barely any barrel. There’s not even that much coconut, it’s just way too sweet of a base – just loads of cheap overbearing chocolate character.

This is too thick, and not drinkable at all, with very little carbonation. There’s not much booziness, but that’s maybe the only single kind of good thing I can say about this.

What happened to you, Weldwerks? Where did you go so wrong?","Jan 19, 2023"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Massachusetts,4.69/5,"This was scrumptious - wow! So much coconut on the nose and palate, plus dark chocolate, nice roast, bourbon, decent sweetness without being cloying; very thicc mouthfeel, great barrel; roasty, coconut finish.","Jan 17, 2023"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Indiana,5/5,"Appearance - The beer was oily black in appearance with carbonation having already been smothered. 

Smell - Coconut came through in a big way, with notes chocolate and sweet bourbon. 

Taste - The initial impression was of both thickness and coconut. The coconut presence was huge. The coconut was complimented by brownie batter and sweet bourbon. The chocolate acted as a backbone for the sweet coconut in the finish. 

Mouthfeel - The beer had milkshake thickness and little carbonation. 

Overall - Perhaps this my favorite coconut beer.","Oct 29, 2022"
Medianoche - Coconut,,New York,4.91/5,"Appearance: Medianoche - Coconut has a deep, dark black color with a thick, creamy head that dissipates slowly.

Aroma: The aroma is strong and enticing with notes of sweet coconut, chocolate, and espresso. The scent is very rich and creamy, making it a delight to smell.

Taste: The taste is rich, creamy, and smooth with a bold flavor profile of coconut, chocolate, and espresso. The sweetness of the coconut balances well with the bitterness of the espresso, making for a well-balanced and enjoyable experience.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky and smooth, with a medium to full body that is creamy and well-rounded. The texture is rich and smooth, making for a pleasant and satisfying experience.

Overall Impressions: Medianoche - Coconut stout by WeldWerks Brewing Co. is a well-crafted and enjoyable beer. The combination of sweet coconut, rich chocolate, and bold espresso creates a bold and satisfying flavor profile that is sure to please fans of stout beers. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, making for a pleasant and satisfying experience. Overall, a highly recommended beer.","Oct 09, 2022"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Minnesota,4.3/5,"Bless my friends at Tavour for delivering this to my door (eventually). Imbibed a few samples at a local beer festival this spring & happy to finally have it from a bottle on my comfortable couch. Split with my stout-guzzling wife. 

Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts. 

Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected. I scoffed at the ‘brownie batter’ description but it’s on the mark & right up front. Well, batter with a shot of bourbon mixed in right after the eggs. Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo. 

Just what I expect from this line of stouts. Thick, sweet, heavy barrel, delicious. Excellent beer.","Aug 05, 2022"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Colorado,4.65/5,"Thick and viscous like oil; impenetrable black body; no head but a bit of percolating carbonation; flat; sediment flecks tread along the top of the beer. Rich aroma; dark chocolate and roasted coffee; coconut. Enormous flavors of milk chocolate, fudge; coconut and bourbon; faint maraschino cherry and peppermint suggestion; subliminal earthy spiciness in the background. Dense, sludgy mouthfeel; heavy slipperiness; incredible residual sugar presence; syrupy; low-level alcohol warmth in the background.

What hath these brewer's created? Sure, a rather dark and dull appearance but the smell characteristics pick things up. Then, you come to the taste and mouthfeel. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! What an awe-inspiring experience. The depth, richness and complexity are nearly out of this world. A beer one needs to experience to fully appreciate what mere words struggle to convey.

Medianoche - Coconut,,Pennsylvania,4.11/5,"No vintage or ABV info on the bottle, but this is the aged Blanton's barrels for 21-24 months version. This looks and feels like stout gravy, I mean this is gelatinous. I can't quite decide if this is too much of a good thing or not. Does anyone else wonder if brewers add corn starch to some of these thicker beers? Weirdly, what few bubbles I could coax from a vigorous pour seemed to exist under the surface. 

This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable.

Edit, there was a weird 2 in long lump at the bottom of my glass. Gross, lowering some scores.","Apr 06, 2022"
Medianoche - Coconut,,New York,4.98/5,"2021 version aged in Blanton’s. Crazy thickness just sticks to the glass. Anchorage Blessed thick. Shiny film on top let’s you know there’s a bunch of fresh coconut. Nose is heavy dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, coconut. First sips are a shot of motor oil with all those flavors. The Blanton’s brings a darkness to the already heavy malt stout. There’s a tiny hint of bourbon bite, but cut by the coconut sweetness. Definitely a sipper with this viscosity. No noticeable carbonation, just still black goodness. Fortunate to have gotten this by Tavour.

Honestly, Thin Man’s Recent Blanton’s BA Coconut Jenkins gives this a run for its money. Their’s is a little brighter, a little less viscous, but on par IMO.","Apr 03, 2022"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Wisconsin,4.82/5,"This is a special beer.

Pours deep, deep black and very oily thick with absolutely no carbonation and no head whatsoever. At the end of my pour, a thin sheen of copper colored beer glistened on the top. The smell is incredible -- the bourbon barrel comes through strongly with notes of chocolate, cinnamon and coconut. The taste is rich, deeply, deeply chocolate with cinnamon, vanilla notes and coconut as well. There is a strong resemblence to brownies laced with alcohol as well as to a rich creme brulee. A noteworthy taste extravaganza.","Apr 02, 2022"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Illinois,4.4/5,"The coffee-coconut was one of my beers of the year last year, from that point onward wanted to try this one. Viscous black body with a short lived brown cap. Nose is laced with bourbon backed dark chocolate with coconut, vanilla, brownie batter, with undercurrents of molasses, roasted malt, oak, and a kiss of cinnamon. Taste is much the same with the huge chocolate, bourbon, coconut and gourmet vanilla, but I find the coffee not being there to cut the sweetness over time hurts this one. This is especially true in the feel, where the heavy, thick, boozy, and massive mouthfeel doesn't do anything to stop sweetness from building. Still a great stout, but the sweetness does add up over time, share the bottle","Apr 02, 2022"

A: Pours jet black, thick as motor oil, with a thick cap of dark brown head. A handful of chunks of coconut (!). No lacing and not much in the way of retention.

S: Melange of dark melted chocolate, toasted coconut, ethanol, and vanilla ice cream. A bit of dark roast, brown sugar, and cola. 

T: Rich, sweet, decadent coconut, dark melted chocolate, and vanilla. Light dark roast, brown sugar. Long finish. Yum. Very dessert-like. 

M: Full bodied, luscious, with light carbonation. Mild alcohol heat. 

O: Very nice, decadent dessert beer. Flavors meld together nicely. The barrel isn’t particularly noticeable, though, and the sweetness and richness limit the drinkability quite a bit.","Jun 15, 2020"
Medianoche - Coconut,,Pennsylvania,4.5/5,"Many thanks to tacosandbeer for this amazing bottle!!

A - Dark brown / black pour with no lacing and small flakes of coconut floating in the glass. Very viscous and oozes down the sides of the glass like syrup with lots of legs. This beer even gives a brown hue on the sides of the glass ... NICE!!

S - Complex aroma with coconut, roasted sweet chocolate, light char, a little bit of alcohol. For almost 14% the ABV is well hidden on the nose. 

T - Toasted coconut is steady from start to finish with sweet boozy chocolate, some char-like roasty-ness and alcohol presence that never overwhelms the beer.

M - Thick, syrupy, velvety, very sticky on the lips, slight warming on the way down.

O - Big and flavorful, this beer is nothing short of amazing. Period.","Oct 11, 2019"

Sunday Brunch,,New York,4.59/5,"Appearance: Sunday Brunch pours a deep, dark brown color with a thick, creamy head that dissipates slowly. 

Aroma: The aroma is rich and complex, with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. There are also hints of toasted oak and a slight smokiness.

Taste: The flavor is bold and intense, with a strong coffee profile and a noticeable alcohol warmth. The dark chocolate and vanilla flavors are present as well, with a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness from the coffee. There is a slight smokiness in the aftertaste that lingers on the palate.

Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is silky smooth, with a creamy texture that coats the tongue. The beer is medium-bodied and has a medium carbonation level, making it easy to drink.

Overall Impressions: Kane Brewing Sunday Brunch is a complex and flavorful beer that is perfect for sipping on a lazy Sunday morning. The coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors combine perfectly to create a decadent and satisfying experience. The alcohol warmth is noticeable but not overpowering, making it a great choice for those who enjoy a bit of a kick with their morning coffee.

500ml bottle served in a footed pilsner glass. 2021 vintage. Received from the glorious @jonphisher.

Pours very dark brown with a small head that fades slowly to an almost invisible skin and a small ring around the glass. Smell is chocolate and cinnamon.

Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.

Mouthfeel is medium tending toward thick. Overall, this is a good beer, but too much cinnamon for me. But, I'm a little oversensitive to cinnamon in beer.","Feb 06, 2022"
Sunday Brunch,,Pennsylvania,4.85/5,"Pours black with a light brown solid head. Super coffee roast aroma, very pungent.

Sunday Brunch,,New Jersey,4.5/5,"-Thanks to Stephanie (Kane) 
- Imperial Milk Stout brewed with Rook Coffee, maple, and cinnamon. 

A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity. 

S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights. 

T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile. 

M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive. 

O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture. Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary.","Mar 13, 2021"
Sunday Brunch,,Indiana,4.59/5,"Appearance - The beer poured an oily black color with a tan colored head and lacing left behind.

Smell - to put it simply, it smells like cinnamon toast. They were definite bread notes. 

Taste - This tasted like cinnamon toast. They were definite bready notes with spice with just a touch of maple sweetness. The cinnamon was nicely balanced and not oppressive. In the back, it leaned more towards bitter coffee as the sweetness faded.

Mouthfeel - Being a porter, it was a little less clingy than a stout with less tendency to coat the mouth. It was still able to linger for a while b

Overall - This was great. It was not as heavy as a dessert stout.","Jan 09, 2021"

L - 2-finger dense hazelnut head recedes as slow as a glacier. Body is pitch black. Clearly a stout.

T - so much cinnamon spice on the taste too. Coffee, vanilla, drinking chocolate. Low bitterness. Low sweetness. Low booziness.

F - medium-full, super-creamy body with low carb.

O - what a decadent dessert stout.","Jan 24, 2020"
Sunday Brunch,,Connecticut,4.51/5,"Big frothy dark tan head; good retention.

Nose is full of roasted barley, dark coffee, maple syrup, and brown sugar, and accented by cinnamon.

Sweet, creamy, and rich on the palate - not unlike egg nog. The coffee adds a sharp earthiness that barely manages to cut through the maple and cinnamon. Big creamy milk porter base is a lovely jumping off point for these flavors. Could use more coffee flavor, but the maple is a wonderful balance, bringing the exact right amount of sweetness, along with a woody note.

Full bodied, sticky, and with a little bit of alcohol heat. I really like the way the alcohol isn't hidden hear, but it's incredibly drinkable and easy to savor.

This is a wonderful beer, worthy of consideration as one of the best maple stouts/porters. The higher ABV provides more of a body than FB MBCP, while keeping it single digits makes it more approachable than many other cinnamon flavored stouts.","Nov 09, 2019"

That being said, the only thing that Raul isn’t feeling is the sweet maple syrup (cause your boi ain’t into sweetness). Also, I wish the mouthfeel in the end was a lil more viscous. It’s not bad.

The maple and cinnamon are more prominent on the taste, which really elevates this, IMHO, because they are the perfect balance to the roasty coffee flavors, and admit milk chocolate flavors to the imperial porter dance party Kane has served up.

The mouthfeel is a bit chewy, which fits this beer perfectly. This flavor profile (chocolate, coffee, maple) is popular, and Kane absolutely nailed this with the cinnamon addition.","Jan 20, 2019"

Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Wisconsin,4.75/5,"2021 vintage bottle share at a bottle share on 12/3/22. Amazing beer; drank fairly easily and just a ton of flavour and barrel in the taste. It was a little on the boozy side, not terrible, but I'd expect that from a 21% ABV beer.","Feb 20, 2023"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Massachusetts,4.52/5,"2020 vintage

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla

This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell

There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains","Aug 23, 2022"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,New York,4.22/5,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.

I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done.","Aug 09, 2022"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Ohio,4.56/5,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!","Jul 23, 2022"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Maryland,4.33/5,"I believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). Leaned towards a more licorice flavor. Didn’t pick up much bourbon. Solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). My guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher, maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where I like my BA stouts.","Apr 16, 2022"

Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Massachusetts,4.55/5,"Review #8000, 2015 vintage. This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit.

Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days

Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol

Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey

Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb

Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there. 

I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!","Jan 23, 2021"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Connecticut,4.56/5,"Very good head production, considering the sky high ABV and double barrel aging. Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored.

Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb.

Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest.

Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly.","Dec 20, 2020"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Alaska,4.75/5,"Not a beer to be trifled with

Ruddy black. Small Borge head quick to dissipate. Vanilla, chocolate, bourbon. Very inviting. Swirling fails to raise more bubbles but reveals legs for days. Alcohol vapor continue to deliver olfactory delights. 

Smooth at first then roasted fire. Long lasting barrel. Huge body. Definitely a sipper. Incredible experience.","Jul 31, 2020"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Vermont,3.59/5,"This is for 2018 and reviewing for the way the current stout game is. The old school back Tuesday is a legendary beer that was a game changer for high abv stouts. Unfortunately compared to stuff now it is extremely thin and way too boozy to be enjoyable. There are some good characteristics of bourbon, sweetness, and fudge. When there weren’t as many options I can see why this beer was great. I don’t know if my pallet has changed or the beer landscape has changed, maybe a little bit of both. There are a wide variety of better ba stouts in smaller formats that are more enjoyable in all aspects right now to have this again unless it was a really well aged bottle.","Mar 03, 2020"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Netherlands,3.73/5,"Got this one from claaark13 a while back. Cheers! 

From a 750 into a snifter
2015 Edition 
Imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels 

APPEARANCE: Pours out a clear brown and yields a small, loose, bubbly light beige head that quickly vanishes to a bubbly ring. Bistre brown body with no carbonation evident. Ring disappears rather quickly leaving this one looking flat and lifeless until the end. 

SMELL: Big bourbon and oak nose on this one. Boozy for sure, with lots of candy-like qualities as well. Vanilla, coconut, milk chocolate and molasses come through, with toffee and butterscotch notes. A slight hint of roasted malt and pure chocolate behind the onslaught of bourbon and oak all over the place. 

TASTE: Piles of bourbon here. Lots of bourbon and oak flavors. Really strong and boozy. Some vanilla, coconut and milk chocolate up front as well, moving into a boozy finish. Bold aftertaste of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, lots of wood and spirit, some pure chocolate bitterness and a touch of roasted malt lingers on the palate. Lots of booze. 

PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Silky on the palate, goes down with a good scratch and burn at the swallow and finishes quite sticky on the palate. Harsh and lots of heat lingers. This feels more like whisky than beer, though it is surprisingly silky and smooth, especially as it settles. 

OVERALL: This is closer to straight spirit than any other incarnation of this beer. Either that or I’ve become a huge sissy since I last had one of these a couple years back. Probably a combination of the two. It seems like the extra barrel aging, which was totally unnecessary in the first place, has made this one even hotter and boozier than the base. Amazing, but yes, it’s boozier than the base. I’m never sure what to think about this bruiser. I admit I find it rather delicious and actually crave it from time to time, but it’s questionable at best as an imperial stout, and as a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout, I often wonder where the stout went. From my notes and memory the 2009 original bottling was one of the best things to ever grace my belly, and unfortunately the successors haven’t quite lived up to that heavenly experience. All that said, this is probably the beer I most look forward to imbibing in again. Weird. Enjoyable for sure, but be ready with an army of the willing at your back, or a solid wine stopper so you can plug it up and enjoy it for a couple weeks. Thanks again, claaark! Always a pleasure.","Jun 04, 2019"

Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Virginia,4.31/5,"2018 release. 

A: Pours a very dark, chestnut brown with a half finger of sand-colored, foamy head. Decent retention, receding quickly to a long-standing ring. No lacing. 

S: Dark chocolate, vanilla bean, oak, with light roast and cola.

T: Prominent okay presence from start to finish, providing some structure and cutting directly through the sweetness endemic to regular BT. Also, dark chocolate, roast, vanilla, cola, and plum. A long oaky, slightly tannic/roasty finish. More roast than I remember in regular BT.

M: Moderate and assertive alcohol heat without the burn. Full bodied with medium-light carbonation.

O: An oaky version of BT. Certainly an interesting take. The lower sweetness is an improvement, but the oakiness is a toe over the line.","Mar 19, 2019"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Massachusetts,4.14/5,"05/2016 - The nose is super hot, with some dark chocolate, a crap ton of bourbon, and some vanilla; the palate is super boozy, with more bourbon, chocolate, and roast than the original; the finish is way too thin to make this super good.

Black Tuesday - Reserve,,Massachusetts,4.53/5,"2015 bottle poured at a share last night. Beer pours dark brown in color. Not completely opaque. Small mocha head forms and dissipates quickly, probably running from the 20.5% abv (haha). Aromas of caramel, fudge, oak and booze fill my nose. Set the glass on the table a few feet away and I could still smell it. Taste is all of the above....lots of fudge, chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oakiness and some definite booze. For 20.5%, I expected some heat, even with a 3 yr old beer. Drinks thicker than it looks. Coated the mouth with vanilla, caramel and booze. Overall, even with the hints of booziness there, this is still relatively smooth. Excellent beer.","Aug 30, 2018"
Black Tuesday - Reserve,,North Carolina,4.75/5,"A: Poured into a snifter to a deep black topped by a half finger of dense dark tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of boozy bourbon with caramel, vanilla and oak leading the charge. There's also some chocolate and a little coffee in there from the roasted malts along with some slight smoke.
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee with roasted malts, a slight licorice note on top of some caramel, vanilla and oak. Faint smoke plays with some toasted marshmallows and a little coconut. Alcohol is there as well. Slight raisin note can be found here as well. Swallow is more roasted malts, oak, chocolate, raisin, dark cherry, caramel, vanilla, and oak.
M: This beer is big and sticky on the palate with carbonation that is so low it almost isn't there. The beer has a very dry finish due to the huge ABV. Residual sugar is still plentiful though.
O: And the hits just keep coming. The amount of complexity this beer is showing is insane. Great depth and breadth of flavors and well balanced. I'm happy they will be making this again because this is too good to be just a one time thing.","Oct 08, 2017"

Black Tuesday - Reserve,,New York,4.29/5,"750ml waxed and capped bottle into a Surly teku. Shared with schen9303. 

On first examination, this actually looks a little thin. Thin legs and very little head. Nose is robust and very aromatic. Big bourbon notes waft over hints of soy sauce, chocolate, fudge, plum, prune and molasses. Great complexity. Beer opens chocolate, soy sauce, molasses and big, accented, boozy bourbon. Syrupy in the beginning and middle with fudge and dried dark fruit notes. Hot throughout and tobacco notes going down. Body is full with low carbonation. Slick, oily and boozy in the mouth and goes down very hot. 

There's great complexity in this beer but the bourbon and booze is just over-the-top at times. Well worth trying but this could still use a year or two and make sure to get at least 4 or 5 friends together for this.","Nov 19, 2016"

Curiosity Twenty Two,,North Carolina,4.44/5,"Poured into a Double Barley can shaped glass. Bottom of can say 09 30 15.

A- Pours a hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves large bubbly clots.

S- Hugely juicy hop aroma that's also a bit musty and dank as well. Lots of stone fruit like tangerine, apricot and a bit of citrusy grapefruit.

T- Again, juicy like I'm drinking some sort of fresh squeezed peach juice. Bitterness is there and vibrant but it melds with the rest of the flavor profile in a way that is very complementary. Notes of peach, blood orange and more grapefruit. A tad sweet.

M- Kind of thin but it makes for easier drinking. Somewhat sharp from the hops as well. Medium carbonation and a lightish body.

O- Really good stuff here. If this is any indication as to what to expect from the cans of Julius I've also acquired, I'm pretty excited. What's really impressive about this beer is how amazingly drinkable it is for the ABV. It's the middle of the day when I don't really crave beer but I'm enticed to take sip after sip after sip since it's so juicy and refreshing. My only criticism id that I wish it had just a wee bit more body to it but, other than that, very well done.","Oct 16, 2015"

Curiosity Twenty Two,,New Jersey,4.95/5,"Look - Looks similar to Julius. Orange juice in the glass. An amazing looking beer.

Taste - Tough to tell if this is a beer......or straight peach/mango juice!!! INSANE!!! So freaking tropical. Got even better as it warmed if you can believe it. 
Feel - TH is so on point with the mouthfeel on their beers. So creamy, so velvety. 

Overall - THIS IS THE BEST BEER I'VE EVER TASTED. Not sure how it can get better than this. The only reason I'm giving this a 4.75 on the overall score section is because I will probably never have this again (depressing).","Oct 15, 2015"

The flavor follows with an onslaught of the signature Juicy Fruit gum from their yeast. Juicy white peach, some yellow peach, ruby red grapefruit, lots of sweet melon, honey dew, cantaloupe, a hint of doughy malt in the middle, then onto orange rind, a medium minus herbacous bitterness.","Oct 09, 2015"
Curiosity Twenty Two,,Massachusetts,4.56/5,"Picked this up last week, but haven't had a chance to crack it yet. Reviews look incredible, so let's see.

Pours a nice creamy foamy like 1.5 finger head that fades at a med pace, nice sticky lacing, typical murky milk shake orange color.

Nose is quite nice, somewhat of cross between Julius and Green almost, nice musty resin notes with a citrus orange creamscicle, with nice New Zealand/Australia style kiwi hops with nice tropical notes and a little floral grassy note, just a touch of creamy malt to base it, the more I smell it the more it seems like Green. Juicy stone fruit notes, some musty passion fruit, papaya.

Taste brings lots of hops, a bit of a Green but a bit different too, a little bit of a new style hop like the mild vinous wine-ish hop note, a little grapevine thing, grassy floral notes but not a lot, I wonder if there's Hallertau Blanc in this. Into citrus again, mild juicy orange cream citrus and a little dank resin to go with it, mild pith, as well as the generic tropical fruit notes, nothing specific popping out, maybe a touch of papaya and passion fruit, or a stone fruit. A mild creamy malt character, a little grassy earthy hop bite on the back end, and a weird bitterness on the finish, not quite astringent but something in that general area, the astringent like drying thing that the bitterness iteself seems to dry the tongue and make it even more bitter, big bitterness as it dries, spicy earthy hop note, back into Green floral tropical notes and grassy as well.

Mouth is med bod, little creamy softness, almost chewy thick like mouth feel, nice carb.

Overall pretty nice, def one of the better curiousity projects, esp lately. Very tasty and enjoyable all around, the big bitterness on the back end with almost astringent thing detracts slightly from it, otherwise would have been amazing. Still a great beer!","Oct 09, 2015"

Mexican Brunch,,Kentucky,4.24/5,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.

As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.

Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.","Nov 09, 2021"

Mexican Brunch isn't exactly what I'd hoped, but it does have a very pleasant balance - the chilis are mild, while the nibs have more of a baker's chocolate quality - not too cloying, not too sweet, not too spicy. It's quite pleasant - I certainly prefer Abraxas, but this is a very nice beer as well. I appreciate that the carbonation isn't super aggressive - it's very easy-drinking.","Mar 25, 2019"

I guess this is ""only"" a porter after all. Creamy, whipped cream tan head with some aggressively sticky lacing. Leaves a fine film on the edges of my glass. The head color is simply divine.

S - burst of chile pepper with spiced hot chocolate and cinnamon powder. Getting the usual spice suspects a la cardamom, nutmeg, and allspice. Nails those Mexican Hot Chocolate vibes.

T - fresh and lively flavors of iced coffee, chili powder (sans heat), and cool whip. Sharp dark chocolate, two creams, and brown sugar. Whipped cacao butter. Maple smooths out any harsh chili heat, and we're just left with pepper flavor, none of the undesirable spiciness. 

F - far creamier than I was expecting, based on the look and nose. Buttered cream, but light enough to make this exceedingly palatable. As close to drinking a cloud as you're gonna get. Soft as that steering wheel cover I got my gf for Christmas. It was so soft, I almost got into an accident because I couldn't stop dragging my hands around it in a circle.

O - delightfully restrained in its balance of flavor. I'm reminded that it's just a porter, and Kane makes every attempt to keep this light and playful, while honing in on the flavors they're after.

Mexican Brunch,,Germany,3.7/5,"Pours an almost entirely dark color with a bigger, soft beige head, collapsing to a coating ring of lacing.

Smells of toasty coffee beans dipped into maple syrup, topped off by a generous amount of cinnamon. This creates a complex, earthy impression, countered by warm chilies and chocolaty bitter cocoa nibs. A milky, soothing, flowery note evolves from this, emphasizing roasted coffee with a sweet edge to it.

Has a very silk, lighter mouthfeel to it, with a helping thickness from the syrup, complimented by a low level of carbonation. Makes the beer easy drinking, while, at the same time it provides an ongoing, long lasting flavor evolution on the tongue.

Tastes of milk coated cinnamon roll among charred coal, milk chocolate and a gentle dryness from the red berries inheriting coffee. Turns even silker after that, with a sweet, maple syrup peak to it among roasty hazelnuts and molasses. Finishes with a slowly evolving coffee dryness from the well entangled coffee with a well working companionship of cinnamon and syrup. 

Not really picking up any chilies, mouthfeel on this is almost a little thin, but the interplay of the remaining ingredients makes up for it, as they provide a great intensity on the palate. The adjuncts dominate the flavors, while they create a great composition among themselves.","Aug 25, 2018"

Black Note Stout,,Pennsylvania,4.25/5,"Recording my review from memory. I drank this last night but wasn't able to write it up.

12oz bottle, my friend drank half and gifted the rest of the bottle for me. He had suggested that we drink it together but our schedules didn't match up and he wanted to crack it open. No bottling date. This is the 2017 vintage, so this beer is probably 5 1/2 to 6 years old!

Look: Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with impressive carbonation for a six-year-old bourbon barrel-aged stout. There was a thin brownish-colored head that reduced to a wispy layer. The head regenerates temporarily after swirling the glass.

Smell: Up front, the aromas on this beer (at least at this age) are all umami, all the time. It has that rich, interesting soy sauce note that is blended with dark chocolate and subtle dried fruit aromas. Secondary notes of vanilla and amaretto.

Taste: I am really impressed that this beer has aged so well. I was expecting it to be dull and flat. But it is really smooth, rich, very flavorful. It's also really drinkable and there is basically no heat on the palate. The umami flavor is really nice and then the beer has a nice dark chocolate richness. The beer has subtle sweetness, and the finish is mildly bitter with nice roasted malt character. The amaretto note is also really nice.

Feel: It's not thin and it's not especially thick either. It's somewhere in the middle, I would say that it is medium plus bodied. The mouthfeel is nice with soft carbonation.

Overall: It's very tasty and really enjoyable. I've never had this before. It would be nice to get a fresh batch of this beer and enjoy one every year to see how it develops over time.","Apr 01, 2023"

Style: Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout
Date: 10/05/2017
This beer has been on my wants for a long time, but I thought I would never get the chance to try it. I was sent this in a box by a fellow beer friend. Using a tulip glass, I served the beer at 52 degrees. The pour created a one in half finger length head with dismal retention. No lacing was left on the glass after the quick dissipation. Charting the color of the beer somewhere around SRM 34, dark brown, nearly black. The appearance is slightly above average, regardless of the head retention. 
Nosing the glass, I detected bourbon, oak, espresso, dark chocolate, cream, oats, raisins, molasses, caramel, toasted bread, dark roasted malts, a hint of char, and a notion of floral. 
Sipping the beer, I taste bourbon, oranges, oak, resin, molasses, milk chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, caramel, toffee, toasted bread crust, oats, a tinge of soy sauce, a hint of Maillard, and a little smoky char. 
The mouthfeel is thick and coated. The body is a medium plus, has low carbonation, and has a delicious finish. 
This beer held up beautifully. I am pleased to have the opportunity to quaff on this stout. Thank you kindly for allowing to have this chance to try a retired beer. Simply a fantastic beer!","Jan 08, 2023"
Black Note Stout,,Massachusetts,4.37/5,"2016 vintage

Another BIF beer from @Eziel, and they only retired beer of the lot. This one was quite the highly regarded beer in its time, peaking at roughly #78 overall based on data from the wayback machine. Let's see if it can hold up to the barrel aged Stouts of today

Pours an opaque medium brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Man this packs a boozy punch in the nose for a relatively low 11.2%. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet bourbon, black cherry, plum, cocoa pwoder, fruity coffee, toasted oak, light tobacco, and vanilla

It's a bit less fruity and more malt-focused in taste, but still just as good. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black cherry, cocoa powder, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, sweet bourbon, vanilla, and lightly burnt coffee. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, burnt coffee, charred oak, cocoa powder, raisin, sweet vanilla, toasted hazelnut, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation from the booze, resulting in a rich beer. Finishes surprisingly dry, roasty and balanced by sweeter notes for a shockingly drinkable Stout

Damn, I liked this one more than I had expected to. Even at 6 years old, this is really good. It's too bad they retired this one","Jul 18, 2022"
Black Note Stout,,Pennsylvania,4.44/5,"12oz bottle into a goblet. 2016 release, so 5 years old.

Looks superb in the glass. Jet black body. Generous tan head shrinks to a ring and faint covering, impressive given the abv, and leaves streaks and spots of lacing.

Aroma is wonderfully boozy with a lot of dried dark fruit.

On tasting, so smooth. Boozy, nicely warms the back of the throat. The dried fruit notes add a hint of sweetness. 

The mouth is a bit thinner than you might think, but it still rolls around the tongue beautifully. Finish is a warming smooth booziness, with a faint sweet note.

Overall, delightful sipper of a beer. Been after this one for a while, so thanks to the mighty Sabatinis in Exeter PA for releasing a case from the cellar.","Nov 29, 2021"

Black Note Stout,,Maine,4.17/5,"335ml bottle - 2017 Vintage (10/05/2017) - poured into a balloon glass at 50°F. 

Pours a deep, dark mahogany brown, sitting absolutely inky jet black in the glass. A super short head of coarse dark tan bubbles forms, before quickly receding to a razor-thin, but,persistent collar.

Nose: Definitely that Bell's barrel-aged aroma here. Much like BA Expo, which makes up half of this, there's a big, dense fudgy aroma, with plenty of dark cocoa-like roast, caramel, and marzipan, with secondary notes of American tobacco, vanilla, leather, and bourbon barrel. There are some signs of age here - mildly faded aroma, as well as some unique notes - musty, a whisper of umami, with a hint of fresh spearmint, and a metallic penny note as well, the latter of which is slightly detracting, but only slightly.

Palate: Black Note greets the palate malt-first, with a moderate sweetness. Dark chocolate, caramel, vanilla, toffee, roasted malts, and a surprising fruitiness. Big plummy dark fruit notes - mainly prune, plum, dried cherry, and bourbon-y apple lend a bright fruity pop, with a touch of acidity. This dark fruit element cuts through much of the malty sweetness, creating a shortcut for the roastiness to come in. Dark malts, barrel char, roast, and cacao nib begin to build a mild-moderate bitterness, and the bourbon character begins to bloom. At this point, it begins to dry out fast, roast taking over the sweetness, and dark fruits fading, as the beer barrels towards a finish with nutty malted milk, hazelnut, cocoa powder, a bit of black roast, barrel char, and ultimately concludes with dry oak and a lingering vanilla cream note.

Body: I cannot say whether or not this is the age, but this one is definitely thin. Unlike BA Expo, or even Vanilla Black Note (which was not a super thick stout), this one is definitely a little runny, lacking any and all chew or viscosity. Definitely some effervescence, and it's fairly full (perhaps medium-full) bodied, but it's very fluid and thin. 

Overall: With Barrel-Aged Expedition being a personal favourite of mine, I had high hopes for this one. I'm thinking maybe BA Expo is really just the best qualities of this in one thread. It's a perfectly delicious bourbon barrel-aged stout, with a particularly fine malt balance and unique creamy nuttiness, but with its subdued aroma, dry delivery, and ultra-thin body, it falls short for me. Super drinkable, if that's what you want, but I find the Vanilla variant far superior, and BA Expo to be the ultimate expression.","Dec 28, 2020"

Black Note Stout,,California,4.14/5,"Re-review in 2020 with the same batch I had in my first review. Bottled 11/3/2016. Into North Coast snifter. We didn't know what Coronavirus was back then. 

Inky, silky black with a small beige head of bubbles. Recedes to a fingernail with some remaining bubbles on top. 

Aroma is chock full of tobacco and fig, with some dry bakers cacao and piney hop right behind it. Lots of roasted malt and karo syrup as well. 

Flavor brings dry cigarette ash mingled with dry cacao and hints of chocolate. Some raisin and pine follow up shortly after. Finish is of leather, grass, very dry bakers cacao, and hints of raisin. I do not get any bourbon barrel.

Feel is slick with a heavy carbonation and a boozy burn though not too much. Slick, resinous finish. 

Overall, this beer fared better for me this time and fares a lot better than many 4 year old beers. This is absolutely a good beer, but the Vanilla Black Note is way better. 

Price paid : $5.99 / bottle in 2016
Would buy again : Yeah I'd give it a swing



Initial review : 

January 15th, 2017

Oily black with a beige-brown head. 

Aroma of old moldy oak barrel, meat locker, snuff tobacco, leather, cigarette butts, and slight vinegar. 

Flavor is a touch milky to start (somewhat thin), but then forms a bit more character with tobacco, earth, and finally on the finish it all comes together - bourbon, rich chocolate, oats, and leather on the aftertaste. 

Feel is thin to start, then begins a medium profile, and finally a thick juicy finish with a roasty dryness. 

Overall, this is the 2nd 2016 bottle I've had this year, and I remember the first one being better. This seems to have some issues regarding smelling a bit vinegary and ashy, with the flavor really lacking until the finish. I remember the first bottle being flavorful all the way through. Sad, but I have one more bottle I can take care of yet before my 2016 stash is depleted. 

Rated with price in mind ($6/bottle).

Black Note Stout,,Tennessee,4.5/5,"Pretty high bar to set, describing it as sharing qualities with Expedition and the feel of Double Cream. Also a beer that I've long wanted to try. But my first experience largely lived up to the high billing.

Jet black body with cola-brown edges. Not as viscous or thick as I expected, but it's certainly a big and bold looking stout. Handsome mocha cap of latte head that collapses quite quickly but leaves a strong circumferential ring of chocolate foam that provides spotty lacing down the glass. Swirls of the glass produce moderate alcohol legs and renewed mocha film that compliments the jet black coloring extremely well.

The aroma and taste profile is as expected, with huge bursts of dark chocolate, roasty and toasty malts, divine dark fruits, exotic woods, licorice, brown sugar, and barrel char. The nose is masterfully layered, with no single note dominating and each whiff leading with something different. On the tongue you get an added streak of whiskey heat and molasses sweetness, with strong barrel personality -- toffee, oak, and a little maple -- standing out. There's perhaps just a tad too much black licorice for my liking, but that's pretty nit-picky. It's not a sweet stout, at all, but the semi-sweetness and strong bitterness balance each other out beautifully.

Feel is thinner than I expected and was hoping for (especially given the Double Cream reference), but it's incredibly smooth and silky with just a wee bit of stickiness. Reasonably carbonated and very little boozy heat.","Jan 25, 2020"

This gives a viscous pour. Thick and heavy from the bottle, with a heady cap of cocoa colored foam. Wonderfully complex nose. I get a light roast, cocoa nibs, a hint of vanilla and just a faint touch of boozy heat. Incredibly smooth. Creeps up on you. An amazing beer. 

2019: at two years of age and the beer remains incredible. So drinkable, with just the slightest hint of heat. That ABV creeps up, but I’m not complaining—this is it for the entire evening.

2021 Black Note tasting:

This beer remains an incredible experience. Big bouquet, with more stone fruit and jammy notes emerging alongside the oak and vanilla from the barrel.

Black Note Stout,,Alabama,4.16/5,"2017 vintage, bottled on 10/05/17. Purchased at Loosa Brews, Tuscaloosa, AL.

Dark, murky pour, without too much viscosity but a great-looking stout poured from the bottle. A decent amount of beige head rises and settles in a good sized ring around the inside of the glass.

Tons of dark chocolate and dried fruit on the nose that swirl around a backbone of oaky booze and roasty malt. Really a little bit of everything you could ask for of the style in the aromas, with the essence only intensifying as it warms.

Distinctly different from the nose, a good compliment. Roasty espresso, caramel, and bitter baker's chocolate flavors, with a potent booziness that laces its way through the palate and lingers along with a predominant malt in the finish. I would have hoped only for a touch more sweetness to cut through that potent booze and bitterness, but it's not at all intended to take away from the overall pleasant experience.

The body is fairly thin, retaining a good amount of carbonation that I feel like could even have been a little softer. Sticky, with a good residual mouth-coating and warm, boozy finish.","May 28, 2019"
Black Note Stout,,Illinois,4.22/5,"12 oz. bottle poured into sinfter. 2017 vintage.

Pours near black with a thin beige lacing.

Nose: First impression reminds me a lot of Expedition stout. Big dark chocolate and roast character. The barrel comes through subtly with some caramel, vanilla, and oak character.

Taste: Chocolate and roast up front followed by the bourbon barrel. Very balanced flavor profile. I like the added dimension the barrel brings but the base beer is coming off like a slightly watered down Expedition to me. As someone who loves Expedition stout I can't help but wish I was drinking straight BBA Expedition instead of the blend. Still a great beer without a doubt.

Feel: Very smooth. Body is noticeably lighter than Expedition stout.","May 25, 2019"
Black Note Stout,,Texas,4.7/5,"I just had the 2017 Black Note Stout and it was great. It's hard to get where I live so I was happy to finally get my hands on it. What a wonderful stout, full bodied and flavorful and yet smooth and easy drinking. It is truly delicious.

Look: dark brown / black with a half inch creamy mocca colored head

Aroma: chocolate and some bourbon.

Taste: Roasted malts, chocolate, moderate bourbon to round it off.

Body/Overall: full body, creamy, silky, smooth","May 07, 2019"
Black Tuesday,,Indiana,4.07/5,"Well, this will definitely get you lit. If you want a clean, bourbon forward stout then look no further. The barrel is over the top but still under control, which makes for an exquisite tasting experience.","Aug 31, 2023"
Black Tuesday,,New Jersey,4.52/5,"Finally gotten my hands on a Black Tuesday. 2021 Version. 18.9% ABV

Pours out a very dark brown liquid with some translucence during the travel from the bottle to the glass. No foam whatsoever. No surprise there. There is a creamy appearance to it though. Like chocolate milk towards the center with more light penetration on the outer edges. 

Nose is straight up strong bourbon and oak against a huge roasted malt backdrop. Ethanol is defintely showing itself. Chocolate is prevalent here as well. Sweet confection, like a rich caramel, interacts with the chocolate and brightens it up. 

On the palate, we've got that huge bourbon for sure. Oak tannins are strong on this one. That chocolate shows up but gets overshadowed by both barrel influence and roasted malt. Some savory notes permeate this brew. This aspect always reminds me of well done street cart pretzels. On the back end there is a beautiful dark chocolate covered coffee bean note that lingers for quite some time. 

Mouthfeel brings heat not only from the ABV but the tannins as well. Hot and drying. Probably would be better off drinking this in the dead of winter, but alas, here I am in the dog days of summer. 

Overall, while I very much enjoyed this brew, the time its taken me to snag this bottle combined with the ever rising prices of, well everything, this one didn't quite live up to the reputation placed upon it. Perhaps I should have aged this one a little longer. Anyway, despite that, great brew, but other breweries do great things that are similar and less costly and even more available.","Jul 05, 2023"
Black Tuesday,,Washington,4.3/5,"2021 can stored in a cooler. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass with a fizzy, one finger light khaki head that quickly dissipates to sparse patches with slight lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, bourbon, dry caramel, chocolate; boozy. Flavor is bourbon, dark toasted malt, bakers chocolate, raisins, dry caramel, oaky vanilla and a touch of licorice. Hot boozy bourbon finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess and sharp carbonation. I've tried a lot of bourbon barrel stouts in my day, and this is the most bourbon forward that I can remember; almost like a bourbon boilermaker that was extra heavy on the whiskey. Fortunately, there is a lot of flavor in the base too, with good chocolate and oak, some dark fruit and caramel that are more reminiscent of a blended strong ale. I was concerned with the fizzy pour, but despite the quick fade of the head, there is plenty of carbonation. There is a lot of intense flavor at the start of the taste, but the bourbon alcohol kicks in and dominates the finish; nice oak and bourbon in the lingering finish. The two years this can has on it has not seemed to mellow the flavor much (and if it has, glad I got an aged one). I expected a big, boozy stout and this delivered. It is a bit on the unbalanced side from the barrel effect, but enjoyable. I'm glad about the sensible 16oz. can over the traditional The Bruery 750s. Glad I had a chance to taste this classic.","Jun 13, 2023"
Black Tuesday,,Florida,4.47/5,"Poured at 54°. Black body with some ruby see-through and good clarity; light brown rocky head dissolved quickly leaving no cap retention, ring nor lace; thick legs sheet the glass on swirl. Nose is bourbon and black licorice; boozy hot retro nasal; molasses as beer warms. Bourbon and bittersweet dark chocolate entry; oaky vanilla; molasses middle; hot phenolic finish. Hot mouth warmth from 18.9% abv; alcohol bite on tip and sides of tongue; full, non adjuncty body; silky feel, light carbonation; barrel dry finish. Overall, you better like boozy (and I do); layers of base and barrel flavors which are well balanced all but for the alcohol which is hot; dry oaky linger; definitely a beer to be enjoyed one sip at a time.","Mar 11, 2023"
Black Tuesday,,California,3.53/5,"2014 Bruery Black Tuesday
19.7%

Seen these on shelves for $50 dollars and it honestly just tastes like Deths Tar just a bit thinner and a bit less sweety but more boozy even after 8+years .
Poured out very light brown( i expected a darker and thicker pour for obvious reasons)and settles dark brown into glass. No head whatsoever. A lil bit of bubbles swimmin up like salmon .

Tastes is dark chocolate, caramel , big dark fruit and heavily roasted malts with a harsh boozy finish. Nothing special.
Way too boozy as well. I feel the burn in my stomach from each sip and it gotten bit overwhelming after 4 sips.
Mouthfeel is too thin for the high abv in my opinion.

Always wanted to try this one and very happy I did. To whoever sent me this one a million thanks cuz Much happier i didn't get suckered in to paying what those bastards are asking for these bottles .

I'm not afan of The Bruery mainly cuz of the prices they charge( i get it gotta pay for barrel storage)and weird ass beers they make , but may buy one So Happens It's Tuesday once a year in pint can .

Overall I can see why no ones gives a fuck about these guys anymore. This is nothing special compared to a lot of stuff on shelves now and tastes way too hot even after 8 years. Makes sense why most members of their beerclub have 750s spoiling in their cellars cuz this is hard to finish and can't imagine getting through half the bottle alone.

Update : still have 1/3rd of the bottle in my fridge 3 days later cuz i didn't wanna drink anymore. 
The price they charge for these is a crime. 

Pro Tip: If you been wondering about this and don't wanna buy cuz of the price tag just buy a bottle of bourbon ... you'll be better off","Jan 23, 2023"
Black Tuesday,,Florida,4.64/5,"Sampled at Cigar City Brewing’s El Catador Club XV bottle share party.
2021 vint. 750 ml bottle.
Poured a hit into a logoed Cigar City taster’s glass. Little spritz of head doesn’t last at all. 
Smell is bourbon heavy chocolate, vanilla bean pod, prunes, vapor of alcohol.
Taste threw me back a step with a full assault of molasses, creme de cacao, dark malt, coffee and oak barrel.,. then the 19% ABV let me know who the boss is.
Feel is mighty mighty and thick. Tounge tar. Rich as Musk. Low carb.

S: Dark chocolate, strong bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, leather, and molasses.
T: Dark chocolate, a burst of dark dried fruit, bourbon, oak, vanilla, toasted caramel malt, crème brûlée, and a vinous note around the edges. With warming, anise and almond notes emerge.
M: Heavy body. Extremely smooth and supple feel. Layers of dark sweetness. Plush vinous feel too. A surprising bit of cola fizziness. Lingering spicy warmth. ABV is well hidden, but potent at 18.9%!

Black Tuesday,,Michigan,4.96/5,"Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!
Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.
The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)
The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.
The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.
OA, Wow, really tasty.","Dec 22, 2021"
Black Tuesday,,Ohio,4.59/5,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 09/13/21, 18.9% ABV. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little bit. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong. Some more age wouldn't hurt this brew at all. I thought this was a pretty good imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you're into big barrel aged imperial stouts!","Dec 21, 2021"

Black Tuesday,,New York,4.7/5,"Pours close to jet black, small cap of tan head that settles to a thin ring; streaks of ruby when held up to light. Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation.","Nov 20, 2021"

Black Tuesday,,Ohio,5/5,"Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father.

Just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma, love it. Tons of flavor on first sip, all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of over-ripe papaya, slight dankness, honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin.

Scaled Way Up,,Connecticut,4.8/5,"L - definitely on the cloudier side of Trillium things. Turbid swamp water with a distinctly brownish milky tint. There was a touch of head at first, but it has since dissipated into a ring of lacing, clinging to the glass.

S - huge aromas. Lights up the entire room as it splashes into my glass. Sticky, resiny, earthy pineapple rind with tingly grapefruit spice. Sweaty onions and dank melon. Hot, humid, tropical.

T - hop saturation. Thick, acidic, yeasty. Somewhat bright grape candy and a floral bite, but the main attraction is pink grapefruit, melon rind, and papaya. Sticky, gritty peach must and pithy tangerine. A light peach halo settles on the hop dust. There's bitterness, but it's not overwhelming. The acidity sucks up any cloying juice, so you end up with mealy, hop-laden deliciousness. Subtle vanilla creamsicle when it's all said and done.

F - it's thick and meaty without having to choke it down. Hearty, satisfying viscosity. Carbonation is a little fizzy, which isn't great and is unfortunately something you'll find in nearly every Trillium IPA, but it's tame here.

A great balance of flavors hits right away. Lots of bitter hops upfront, earthy piney focus. As it settles your get more citrus flavors, namely grapefruit.

Scaled Way Up,,Massachusetts,4.28/5,"Thanks for the can Kevin!

A- Tallboy to a small snifter with a murky yellow-orange body and a one finger, frothy cap. Decent head retention as the crown falls to a small ring around the edges. Spotty lacing is seen rarely around the glass.

S- Bright orange juices and juicy citrus fruits (mandarin, tangerine) come out on the front end of the aroma and burst out of the glass. Plenty of other hops to back that with peach, bubble gum, mango, apricot, papaya and dank weedy herbs. Hops hops hops. Bright, clean and fresh.

T- The citrus hops pick up a lot and shift more towards the grapefruit and orange part of the spectrum but stay fresh, juicy and zesty. The bitterness also picks up and is on the level of biting into a citrus peel, intense and sharp. Peach and mango are downsized here and bubble gum, dank weed, pine resin, berries, bitter Seville orange marmalade and hop powder astringency join in as well. 

MF- Smooth creaminess and puffy texture to the medium bodied ale. A high level of carbonation and a silky feeling on the palate. Ends rather bitter and sharp gripping the taste buds.

The aroma had me very excited as it is truly brilliant with bursting citrus juices, smooth tropical nectars and dank herbs exploding from the glass; truly balanced and fresh hop aromas. The flavor sees an intense bitterness and astringent powdery feeling taking over and pushing those more delicate flavors to the backburner.","Feb 28, 2018"

Grapefruit pith, hard peaches, garlic, and oily weed. Zero malt, quite bitter, and very dry. Finishes with lingering, pithy citrus and some throat warmth. 

What a bruiser of a hop- bomb and certainly the hoppiest Trillium I've tried.","Feb 21, 2018"
Scaled Way Up,,Illinois,4.73/5,"On draft at Trillium-Canton. Appearance is basically orange juice both in color and opaqueness. Tropical fruit and great aromatic aroma. Fruity.

Scaled Way Up,,Virginia,4.18/5,"Canned about a week ago.

A: Pours a light hazy orange with a finger of bright white, dense head. Very good retention and lacing.

S: Dried potpourri, orange julius and orange pith, hay, and very light grainy malt.

Alter Ego,,Washington,4.29/5,"16oz can courtesy of Roguer.


Orange-honey color, I'd call it highly hazy or cloudy in appearance, but not truly opaque like some NEIPAs. Thick, creamy looking head, colored somewhere between off-white and beige. Lots of lace and sticky globs of foam adhered to the sides of my teku as said head dropped.

Aroma is reminiscent of tropical fruits, melons, stonefruits and grapefruit. Big hoppy nose to this, in a way that straddles the NEIPA and WCIPA styles. Curious to see if the beer's hoppiness is as dramatic in the taste.

Up front, it's actually a little less intense than I was expecting. It's definitely a fruit forward beer in terms of the flavor hitting the taste bud beachhead, but it's a bit more restrained. At the finish it is sharply bitter, almost grassy and quite dry. This sharp dryness seemed to mellow as it warmed a little after opening.

Soft, slightly creamy mouth feel.

I'm not sure this is my new favorite hazy, but it'd be in the conversation and I'd hit it regularly if it were local to me. Thanks for this, Andrew!","Dec 14, 2022"

Aromas of oranges, mango pineapple, grass and earth. Moderate to strong smell.

Med carbonation. Full bodied but thinner than their DIPAs. Strong bitter aftertaste.

There's a nice strawberry flavor that is pretty unique in my experience that I could see really appealing to some people.

Pours a deep orange, opaque hazy brew that veers toward the ""turbid"". Huge dense foam head with a light khaki color.

Aroma is incredibly loud, sweet orange, strawberry, pineapple/mango/nectarine, just an absolute fruit salad. Really pleasant 

Taste is bitter at first (probably just jarring compared to the aroma) with citrus pith hitting hard. Then it widens out to a soft, berry forward fruitiness. Nice bitter finish that lingers pleasantly. A little watery all in all.

Alter Ego,,Pennsylvania,4.18/5,"Pours an opaque dirty straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has notes of over-rippened tropical fruits with a hint of citrus.

Taste: Ripe tangerine and grapefruit paired with tropical mango and pineapple. The body is sweet and minimally zesty, the finish bitter and dry. 

Feel: Full and juicy, almost creamy. Medium carbonation.

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite.

Alter Ego,,Massachusetts,4.46/5,"Canned 4/27/22. “You can call me Al” stamped on the bottom of the can

So this was literally canned fucking today. That’s wild to me, as fresh as Tree House can be. This is one I’ve somehow missed every time I take a trip out to the brewery, but I’m happy to finally get to it. Yet another TH beer in the top 250 as well. Let’s get into it

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose shows a surprising amount of balance, but it makes sense considering it’s based on Julius. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya

It is similarly balanced in taste, feeling bright and juicy. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tangerine zest, crackery malt, juicy mango, earthy hops, orange juice, and peach. The swallow brings notes of peppery hops, tangerine zest, crackery malt, papaya, gooseberry, and light orange zest

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

Yet another killer NEIPA from Tree House. Better than Julius, but not quite as good as King Julius still. Maybe it’ll be even better when it’s not so fresh","Apr 27, 2022"

My first review of 2022! Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1. This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA, though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style, but whatever. It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit

It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice. The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit, orange juice, tart guava, apple skin, and pineapple

A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and brisk beer. Finishes mostly dry and very tart

This is really good stuff, definitely worth trading for. I gotta get my hands on more of these J. Wakefield Berliners","Jan 02, 2022"
Miami Madness,,New York,4.24/5,"Bottle pour at Other Half Finger Lakes in Bloomfield, NY.

This smells like lemon, lactic acid, sweet mango, guava, passionfruit, and citrusy funk.

This was probably earth shattering 5-6 years ago, when nothing like this existed. As it exists now, it's just a pleasantly tart fruited berliner with a semi-restrained fruit character, at least compared with the smoothie overload most breweries are doing these days. It's very drinkable, and you could easily see taking down a whole bottle of it if you so needed to.

Miami Madness,,Massachusetts,4.39/5,"On tap at Lulu's in Allston, MA.

Looks like a well-made NEIPA in the glass with a lovely stiff-peak eggwhite head that retains surprisingly well for the style. Aromas scream passion fruit, mango, and guava. Just a hint of pale malt character coming through. The passion fruit is strong in the flavors, too. Perhaps a hair on the tart side, had a bit of an apple cider vinegar character. Refreshing and quite drinkable. I definitely have my qualms with beers that are so heavily fruited they just take like unsweetened fruit spritzers, but I have to respect this one for how damn far they took it. This seems to be a slightly different recipe, the ABV is now 7%.

A: A: hazy to murky yellow, with low visible carbonation. Forms a two-finger white head that fades fairly quickly.

S: A big punch of fruit up front - mango and guava and pineapple. Musty with some funk. Lactic tartness and wheat-cracker malts.

T: Juicy mango and papaya, guava and pineapple fruity cream whip. Lactic tart, and a funk that makes me wonder if the pineapple is part of the tropical fruit profile or from a Brettanomyces addition. A touch of wheat pokes over the very light cracker malts in the middle. Tangerine and orange citrus show up as the beer warms too, along with more of the tropical fruit mix. Dry Lactobacillus, citric acid, and a dry lactic finish with more mango fruitiness.

M: A light body but with a bit of a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation sensation just on the low side, and there's no alcohol to speak of.

O: Very, very yummy - South Florida in a glass. A nice meld of flavors, and while the acidity level would render me unable to drink it all night, it's at an enjoyable level for splitting a 750 two ways. Well done.","Oct 08, 2017"

Saint Lamvinus,,Portugal,5/5,"This was drank almost a week ago, at Vítor Claro's home - the winemaker from Portalegre, behind the Dominó and Claro & Ferreira brands.

Trying to review this from the top of my mind.

Poured from the bottle to a stemmed wine glass.

A: The body is dark purple with a light purple, almost pinkish head. Created a generous foam quantity that lasted quite a while before jumping in.
S: The aroma is actually perfect without any overpowering acidity. It's balanced as it is sweet, savory, and acidic to the right point. It's a great beer only by smelling it.
T: It's the taste of heaven. I think that after Fou'Foune, this might be my favorite Cantillon beer. It's perfectly balanced with the sweet notes from the grain and the grapes embracing quite well the light fruitiness, and very light bitterness of aged hops combined with just the right amount of acidity incoming from Brettanomyces. It's really great with nothing to point to as a downside.
M: Body has just the right feel, being light with the cool effervescence and silky tones from the sweetness you can find in this beer. Bitterness is low. Acidity is mild.
O: As said before, this ranks at the top of my favorite beers. Unbelievably good.","Aug 18, 2023"

Great red counterpoint to Vigneronne. Huge barnyard funk in the aromas with a bit of red wine coming through in the back. Tart, tannic, and winey in the flavors. Maybe a bit vinegar-y, but that's how it is with Cantillon. Basically the liquid equivalent of farmhouse cheese

what I can add from memory: for me, this is the one from that first flight that had the most personality, and I think my drinking buddy would agree, he being a luster of red wine... I believe this beer poured near brilliantly clear, making its reddish-purple hue more vibrant and alluring, mwahaha... its slight phenolic note definitely hits first and firm, while its fruity flavors take a few moments to surface... the 'plum' flavor for me wasn't so much fresh fruit as it was a ghostly concentrate essence of floral fruity aromatics, lingering in the background... would love to try it again from a bottle (2039)","Sep 26, 2022"
Saint Lamvinus,,New York,4.24/5,"Pours a rich, deep purple, brief pink head that settles to a thin ring, light lacing.

Welp, I inadvertently ended up here for Zwanze Day! I was at a show right down the road at Palladium and figured I’d come here after, only to find some true whales of mine. It’s finally time to see what their grape Lambic is all about

Pours a clear reddish purple with a finger of light pink head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

It’s quite soft in the nose, but there’s still the requisite funk. I’m picking up on aromas of red wine vinegar, lemon juice, wheat bread, wet hay, stone, and sharp oak

There’s more bite to it in taste, but conversely less grape. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting wildflower honey, lemon juice, straw, apple skin, red grape, light toasted oak, and a hint of cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, wet hay, sharp oak, red wine vinegar, crabapple, light blueberry, and pear skin

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and tart

Saint Lamvinus,,Maine,4.47/5,"2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F. 

Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty.

Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil. 

Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith. 

Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins. 

Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity.","Dec 25, 2020"

Saint Lamvinus,,Colorado,4.53/5,"January 1st, 2016 - I'm feasting on the 2010 addition of this bottle, and it is a European treat, with a barnyard smell that is appealing even if it is a little feral. It has a rich, fecund, manure scent with horse blanket and soil. At last, after seeing these descriptors attached to wine and cheese and other delicacies I can see why animal poop can be something nice on a beer's bouquet. And the beer surprises again with the first taste, and an incredibly well crafted sourness, with any excessiveness acid trimmed and leaving a brilliant profile. It hints and teases at sweetness, but falls just short, instead offering tartaric tang. Brilliance in a bottle, with a side of horse.","Mar 17, 2020"
Saint Lamvinus,,Pennsylvania,4.1/5,"Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF #10. Reviewed 1/19/20. Thanks Derek!
Faintly stamped on rear label “2018”. A more legible dating is found on the cork which broke when being pulled. The end of the cork exposed to the lambic was stained opera mauve. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 54 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 57 degrees.
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Mauve, clear.
Body – Garnet, translucent. When held to direct light, cardinal red and clear.
Head – Gone by the end of the pour. A single tiny bubble-wide crown and no cap remain.
Lacing – None. 
Aroma – 4 – Initially a very fruity grape odor which fades into a weak vinous fragrance.
Flavor – 4 – Begins slightly bitter with subdued grape flavor. Ends slightly dry with a bit of pink grapefruit aftertaste on the tongue. Not sure if the bitterness is from the grapes used, the lambic process, or some tannins from the barrels – it’s more of a background teeth-squeaking thing. No alcohol (7 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide.
Palate – 4 – Medium, watery, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. I love the color. Where I live, concord grapes rule, and I’m not a wine drinker (except for an occasional bottle or three of tawny port), so beer based on Merlot grapes are somewhat of a novelty. Now, I think it’s time to start seeking more Saint Lamvinus. Thanks Derek – I needed a new quest!","Jan 19, 2020"
Saint Lamvinus,,Germany,4.52/5,"Pours a clear, deep, dark ruby red coloration with a small, fizzy head that fades to a thin ring around the glass almost instantly, with very slightly visible carbonation. Smell is quite dominated by a lovely tart red grape aroma, with milder notes of blue cheese funk and musty oak, as well as just a hint of red berries and mild tannins. Taste is an excellent balance of quite vibrant, slightly tart red grapes, some light blue cheese funk and a distinct, mildly tannic, musty oak presence, as well as subtle hints of red berries, lemon peel and balsamic vinegar. Finishes quite dry, with a light tartness and some red grapes and musty oak lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

While the sour and funky notes are a lot more subtle here than I expected, this really makes up for that with an absolutely sublime balance of vibrant fruit character, strong oak presence and funky highlights, while also displaying quite a dry body rounded out by a light sweetness. The red grape and berry notes, as well as mildly tannic, musty oak lends a certain vinous quality to this that is quite pleasant and also enrichens this with a certain depth, while still remaining quite refreshing and easily drinkable at the same time. A superb Lambic overall, that is perhaps not quite as rich and complex as other examples of the style, but makes up for that with a subtle, nuanced balance that is absolutely sublime.","Jan 12, 2020"

Sugary tropical fruits and underbrush. Mango, candied orange peel, a little lacquery alcohol. (4.25)

It is a nice little hop showcase that manages to be multiple things at once, all in harmony. I have a hard time describing it but the aroma and flavors are balanced along the border of the classic IPA flavors (old and new). Different facets of different hop characters holding each other up. Drinkable and generally enjoyable. I'd like to try it with a little smoother alcohol presence maybe, though admittedly I feel like that does add to it a little bit. As usual, a well put-together beer that is a lot of things at once without any sticking out like a sore thumb. I'd gladly have it again and am thrilled that I have one more in my fridge.

Then upon tasting, very heavy bourbon. Almost overwhelming and unbalanced. The vanilla is faint at first but as the more sips I take, the heavy sweet vanilla character starts to build. Faint marshmallow and vanilla bean ice cream. But I don’t know...for the hype, I kinda expected a little more sweetness (talking liquid dessert) from the vanilla and maybe less booze. 

Mouthfeel more medium bodied; not super full and thick but still some richness from the flavors.

Given the name of this one, I expected an absolute vanilla bomb, and that’s not quite what I’m experiencing here. There’s a very big and very brash barrel character. It’s leather-like, spicy, caramelly, and slightly fruity. The vanilla is kinda bittersweet, a bit fruity and earthy, without descending into pure pastry. The base stout is very fudgy and roasty. The vanilla comes out a bit more strongly and sweetly as the beer warms up a little bit.

This is medium bodied, not quite thick level, but definitely not even close to thin. There’s a bit of booze but nothing overwhelming.

Nillerzzzzz,,Ohio,4.38/5,"Viscous oily black with a burnt tan collar that dies off to a motor oil surface in no time.

Super thick and sweet, right away this reminds me very much of Dark Lord, which I just so happened to have had right before this. We also had Goose Island's OG 2010 nilla, VR, and 2018 BCBS Vanilla right before this, so the contrasts and comparisons are all the more readily available. There's a little heat, and an almost maple sweetness, as notes of dark chocolate chip cookie and marshmallow fluff emerge mid-palate.

But in the end, I wanted to like it more than I did. Being self-aware enough to recognize that, it's not as good as it's been made out to be.

---

The above review was for the 2019 blend #2. I just had the pleasure of trying a 2020 blend #3 in July of 2021 and found the experience to be a little more enjoyable.

Gobs of vanilla frosted brownie batter express up front, but shortly thereafter more barrel comes forth than I noticed in the prior vintage. It's more mature and very bourbon ribboned throughout the medium-thick body as a result, bringing it's crackly thin carbonation to a dry and fairly hot finish.

I'm going to up my 4.17 review a bit. While a bit spicy, I like the trendline here.

At Great Taste of the Midwest 2022, I had a taster of blend #5 that yet again reaffirmed both my enjoyment but slight underwhelment of this beer.

I had a pour on my way home from the Assassin 2018 release - perhaps I was just tremendously hungover (definitely). I didn't pick up much barrel, and left slightly disappointed.

Batch #2: There was a surprise pre-release of this beer at a local bar - I was a bit floored, honestly, because it's so much better than batch #1. The vanilla is much more distinct and well-defined, and it's just smooth as you might possibly hope for. Barrel is still not all that easy to pick up, but honestly, that's not such a big deal to me.

Nillerzzzzz,,Oregon,4.33/5,"750ml waxed bottle. Snifter glass. Dark black body, oily legs, one finger mocha head, good retention. Big whiskey presence; slightly smoky bourbon and spicy rye combine with a big milk chocolate and cocoa presence on the base stout providing a nice sweetness. Earthy hops and oak rounds things out. The whiskey is heavy on this one, befitting the extended aging time, and the complexity is very nice. The vanilla seems conspicuously absent, and I think it is covered up by the barrels a fair amount. I don't get that marshmallowy mouthfeel that I was hoping for. That being said, it's a nice big stout with a ton of barrel without it being overwhelming- the base stout holds up well to the extended barrel-aging time, however the vanilla is lacking on this one. If you are looking for the likes of BCBVS/VR or BVDL where you are drinking liquid marshmallows, you'll be a bit disappointed even though the beer itself is still a very excellent barrel aged stout. Judging from all the other reviews, perhaps the vanilla is less prevalent in the bottled edition than it was on draft. I'll never know.","Aug 12, 2018"

The first time it touched my lips, I thought I was drinking Assassin. It's got all the vanilla you'd expect but the real story is what they've done to the base stout. They use some kind of barrels that are smaller than your normal Heaven Hill type. Like they come from a small craft distillery somewhere. This was my first time at Forager so I know very little about them. What I DO know is that Nillerzzzz is ""Next Level"" stuff!!! It's quite obvious they spared no expense in the making of this beer.

Oil black. Great layers of sweet vanilla. Nice barrel. Bourbon, oak, molasses. This is a lighter flavored Nillerzzzzz than some of the other releases. Has a nice roasted malt note to it. 4.35","Jun 02, 2018"
Nillerzzzzz,,Colorado,4.62/5,"a beer of astounding depth of flavor, and another hit from forager in this adjunct imperial stout or porter category, wow, they are positively killing it with this kind of thing. this is a huge stout, aged in both bourbon and rye barrels from what i understand, and then conditioned on vanilla beans from five different parts of the world. sometimes efforts like this seem like a lot of work for little gain, but anyone can make a beer thats say a 9 out of 10 in a style like this just by having a little know how and a good attention to detail and some knowledge of the ingredients, but to make something that is truly off the charts and this distinguished, especially in a style that everyone is making these days, it takes this kind of idea and effort (not to mention the likely expense!). i am lucky to have had this. its got more vanilla to it than almost any other beer i can ever recall, but rather than being sugary and forced, its this unbelievable vanilla richness and saturation, so natural somehow, like opening up and scraping out the beans from the pods, its absolute essence! the bourbon adds some maple and honey sweetness and some woodiness, all of which love and enhance the vanilla. the rye adds a little spice and texture to give depth and balance, smart call to use both kinds of whiskey barrels here. its all in service of this crazy vanilla complexion, i wish i knew more about the different beans and where they come from and how thats relevant in the beer, but all i can do is stand back and appreciate this one, vanilla like i have never known in any beer, and it makes some of those absurd ones from the likes of prairie and the bruery seem pathetic, no joke! boozy and fancy, this is some special liquid!","Apr 11, 2018"
Nillerzzzzz,,Missouri,4.73/5,"L: pitch black with a ring of head
S: big boozy barrel and big vanilla to compliment it. 
T: just like the nose, a good back and forth between barrel and vanilla. 
F: highly carbonated, lots of tingly bubbles, medium thickness and good coating on my teeth.","Mar 30, 2018"

XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Ohio,4.74/5,"2021 Vintage. Opened first within a couple months of release.

This is really fantastic, but so is regular benthic (2021), specifically and especially when fresh. Lots of coconut, but not in the pastry territory of something like Coconut Vibes. Coffee is still present, but balanced by the coconut. Mouthfeel is on point. 

I tried to rate this for what it is, not whether or not I felt a little let down - which I did. I had expectations that it would be a little more coconut forward. In fact, I'm not sure it is truly that much different than regular benthic, but that doesn't make it any less delicious. It just didn't quite meet the expectation I set for it.","Oct 31, 2022"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Texas,5/5,"This was the best of the variance for 2021. While it was very sweet, it wasn’t overwhelming and you definitely could discern all of the adjuncts while getting plenty of paste out and barrel. Amazing beer","Jul 27, 2022"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,California,4.42/5,"Pours jet black, with a delayed yet aggressive dark tan head. Shockingly dense and abiding for having so much coconut.

Aroma is pure sweetened coconut.. and honestly, I am struggling to find anything else. It’s quite overpowering, and while the aroma is very nice, I’m missing the barrel and the coffee to balance it all out.

Oh my god, so much coconut. Sticky, milk chocolate covered coconut candy, coagulated coconut oil, oaky bourbon, espresso brownie batter. It’s a good thing it’s a 12 oz can. Any more and it would be tough to finish. As it warms, it becomes very sweet, and syrupy. Begging for more barrel, but it just barely squeaks through.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s the definition of “pastry stout.” Pushing the limits of sweet ingredients that you can hardly recognize that it’s beer anymore. A touch of restraint or a tweak in ratios would have done wonders for the beer.","Mar 18, 2022"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.59/5,"16 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 10/13/20, had 3/20/21.

Pours near black and opaque, thick looking, with a half inch foamy head and light, foamy cling. Aromas of coconut, coffee, bourbon, malt, chocolate. All distinct and vibrant. The flavors are also distinct and intense- coconut, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, malt, some vanilla as it warms. Smooth, an excellent full body, appropriately carbonated. 

This is one fine beer. Strong and flavorful coconut, with the barrels and coffee right behind in flavor and impact. Just delicious. Extremely enjoyable.","Jun 10, 2021"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.13/5,"16oz can, dated 10.13.2020, poured into a Half Acre ""occult"" snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and opaque with a thin khaki head, loose bubbles and no retention nor lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of rich chocolate, charred oak, bourbon spirit, hot and a little bit of fusel alcohol comes through, vanilla, coconut, rich coffee and stone fruits. The flavors are nice, lots of rich chocolate, nice coffee that offers a bit of acidity and fruitiness that draws out some more darker stone fruits. The barrel has a lot of heat, lots of char but offers some toasted coconut, toffee and caramel forward bourbon while being dominated at the finish by alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick, heavy body with a warm and smooth finish.

Verdict: A nice Benthic variant, but definitely the booziest Benthic I've come across. The balance starts off well but suffers a bit from the heat of this beer and the coffee is the element that fails to come across the most.","Mar 07, 2021"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.65/5,"This beer is rich! Rich, creamy with a lot of coconut on the nose and in it's taste. Coffee is relatively predominant but not over powering. Excellent stout. Perhaps the best of the variants from 2020.","Feb 03, 2021"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Wisconsin,5/5,"Easily the 2020 beer of the year for me. My new standard for BA coconut stouts. HA made hefty promises in their description of this beer, and did they ever deliver!","Jan 28, 2021"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.99/5,"Absolutely wonderful. The coconut is certainly the aromatic on the nose; while at taste it’s highlighted as the main flavor and perfect, velvety thick chocolate body is balanced well by the fantastic Dark Matter coffee.","Jan 17, 2021"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.96/5,"One of the best BA stouts with adjuncts that has graced my lips. Slightly better than Vanilla Benthic 2020 with more bourbon and oak. This version really has amped up every aspect of regular and the coconut shines. Like drinking a liquid bourbon macaroon with a cup of joe. 

Some minimal head on the pour that melted quickly, small amount of lacing. Nose is a perfect blend of bourbon, mounds bar and espresso. Above average thickness but not motor oil. Has a dry enough finish that you can just pound this, a dangerous proposition as the booziness is not present beyond the bourbon flavors. 

Definitely one of the top 5 for me in 2020 and up there with Catch Hell for the best Half Acre BA stout.","Dec 30, 2020"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.75/5,"Pitch black oily body with a thick finger of brown foam that died down quickly. Smell and taste are the same, not a lot of nuance but wow is it amazing: toasted coconut like a macaroon with huge milk chocolate, supporting bourbon, and fudgy chocolate cake and dark roast coffee. Taste especially invokes german chocolate cake, while espresso truffle in the smell. Rich, yet not massive in scale, thick and viscous though, adjunct textures add layers of airiness from the coconut and velvet smoothness from the coffee. Right up there with vanilla benthic, a sweet nectar of a stout, incredible! The wife loved it","Dec 17, 2020"
XTRA DUBL Benthic,,Illinois,4.25/5,"Canned 10/13/20; drank 11/27/20 @ the Yarchives. 

Black appearance. 

A rough pour yielded a HUGE dark tan head which quickly dissipated; minimal lace. 

Coconut & milk chocolate notes in the nose; mild booze heat emerged as this warmed. 

Creamy medium thick mouthfeel. 

Coconut & chocolate syrup flavors up front; mild dark roast coffee bean notes on the finish.

Last Buffalo In The Park,,Illinois,4.29/5,"Both last snow and this in the same year, neat! Jet black body with a brown head, standard but well done. Huge coconut right away in the nose, bourbon is present but light, get bakers chocolate and caramel more. Taste is surprisingly similar, while coconut laden nose is fun, want more barrel for the taste. Malt work stabilizes the complexion though, with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish. The feel is very smooth, but it is light in both body and barrel, coconut defines somehow even more than LS. Like last snow better, but still a nice porter. Coconut fans this one is for you!","Dec 17, 2020"
Last Buffalo In The Park,,Thailand,4.8/5,"Pitch black with a reddish pink brown beige head of one finger.

Last Buffalo In The Park,,California,4.5/5,"Tried the 2017 which was one of the best Porters I've ever had. Great all around nose, balance, mouthfeel, flavor profile and finish. Wonderful fresh and still great a couple of years later.","Jul 21, 2020"
Last Buffalo In The Park,,Florida,1.34/5,"A tremendous let down. The barrel aged version of Last Snow, and just as big of a let down.

Look: Pours what looks to be light-medium bodied. That’s immediate disappointment. You’re a barrel aged porter, you should look robust and either full bodied, or the high end of medium bodied. 

Nose: What’d you expect: Coconut and Barrel mostly.

Taste: Barrel Aged Coconut Water

Feel: Far too light in my mouth for what I’m looking for.

Overall: Like the other porters I’ve recently tried from Funky Buddha, I had high hopes, only to be let down. Beer Advocate has about 150 beers with a 100 rating, and this is one of them. It is not deserved. This is total swill.","Jul 09, 2020"
Last Buffalo In The Park,,Massachusetts,4.19/5,"Drank 03.24.20 out of a tulip, bottle dated 2016 or 2017, properly cellared. 

Hate to say I was slightly underwhelmed. A nice looking beer with a nice feel, not at think as I've come to expect from FB, but still good. Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit. The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts. And no hint of alcohol or barrel at all - this would have help for me. So be it, my opinion. I'd like to try a fresher bottle, but given the cost, probably only if I'm gifted it some day...fat chance at that! Cheers!","Mar 25, 2020"

Last Buffalo In The Park,,New York,4.84/5,"The imperial version of Last Snow porter is everything I hoped it would be. It pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger brown head that faded slowly and left minimal spotty lacing.

It smells like coconut, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, toasted coconut, notes of whiskey and/or spices like rye. The aroma was very complex and full of rich malty aspects that blended perfectly with the coconut and boozy sweetness. 

Wow this tastes fantastic, with plenty of fresh coconut then coffee beans, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, bourbon, toasted coconut, espresso, faint molasses, brown sugar, notes of whiskey and/or spices like rye. Some sweet aspects but not cloying and in no way a distraction from the outstanding flavor combination here. The mouthfeel is perfect and this has zero alcohol burn. World class.","Jan 25, 2020"

Last Buffalo In The Park,,Illinois,3.97/5,"Pours a shiny dark black color. one full finger velvety mocha colored head collapses steadily leaving no residual head. Thin ring of foam is left along the outside of the glass. 

Aroma is predominately coconut - a bit suntan lotion-y - but still decent. Hints of cocoa. Its rather one note with the coconut being predominate on the nose. Also very sweet - you can just smell the sweetness here. 

Taste follows the nose with strong notes of coconut up front. Underneath this, there are notes of roasted malts, chocolate, and vanilla. Not much in the way of barrel presence or bourbon. 

Feel is semi-thick pretty slick and oily. Mild carbonation. Semi-dry finish. 

Overall its a nice beer - to me the coconut is far too predominant - especially in a barrel aged beer.","Nov 17, 2019"

Last Buffalo In The Park,,California,3.63/5,"The look and mouthfeel of this beer are world class.

Last Buffalo In The Park,,Missouri,4.47/5,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is big, bold coconut right at the forefront. Vanilla bean quickly follows coconut. What happens next is a mixture of gift shop fudge, toffee and coffee and hearty stout malts, with notes of toffee, molasses, caramel, coffee and roasty, toasty, caramely malts charging through. There is a very light whiskey heat on the edge, but it melds into the background well. Flavor profile continues to push the coconut heavy narrative, with vanilla bean coming on second. Between the two, the onset is very sugary. The remainder of the flavor profile works its way back towards balanced by order of notes of toffee, caramel, molasses, coffee, and roasty, toasty malts. Whiskey starts to come on at the end to boil away some of the sugar. Whiskey melds in well, never coming off as hot or out of place. Mouth feel is thick with a grainy velvety texture that feels decadent each and every sip. Overall, boisterous with a lot going on, with coconut and vanilla bean at the helm. 

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 22oz bottle.","May 27, 2019"
Last Buffalo In The Park,,Missouri,4.29/5,"Black in color with no light penetration. There’s a fingernail of beige around the rim and just a trace of it showing elsewhere.

Last Buffalo In The Park,,Indiana,4.52/5,"Pouring this from a 22 oz. bottle into a snulip glass, this beer pours out like a dark brewed coffee, with little wood like highlights running throughout. It forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly. 3.75

The nose carries a stinging bourbon before even putting my nose to it. Putting my nose into it brings it with a more toned definition. There is freshly cut coconut mixing with brown sugar and that warming bourbon with a kiss of dark fruit. They achieved a very natural coconut; no suntan lotion smell. 4.75

The taste brings in the brown sugar just tangling with freshly toasted coconut all the way through. Slight milk chocolate, but just as an accent. It’s almost like a coconut pie drizzled with some chocolate. The bourbon is there with some dark fruit accents, but they didn’t let this stray too far away from what the base is. 4.5

The mouthfeel is smooth and doesn’t have a bourbon burn to it, just a nice, balanced warmness to let you know it’s there along with a dryness from the barrels. I would call it medium bodied. 4.5

Overall, this didn’t stray far from the base at all (despite the almost double ABV) but did add a new dimension to it with a few nice layers. After having this and Morning Wood last week it makes me wonder how long they age these in barrels. I would guess minimal aging (3-5 months) just because the way they are more accenting than anything. Which isn’t a bad thing to me, but just doesn’t morph the beer like you’d guess. 4.5","May 12, 2019"
Last Buffalo In The Park,,New York,4.57/5,"A slick black color with a frothy brown head. These guys seem to make some of the most strongly smelling dark beers that I have ever had. Big notes of coffee, chocolate, and spices. The drinking starts smooth and silky upfront with tons of lush chocolate malts. A smooth flow that finishes ever so slightly bitter. The coffee falls on the subtle side but the highlight flavor is clearly the coconut. I love coconut and the flavor comes off spot on genuine. Additional notes of tannin, smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, caramel, cocoa powder, and smoke. The mouth feel is superb- full bodied with such a lush and silky feel. Not overly sweet and not terribly sticky but enough to still allow the flavors to linger nicely after each sip. A slight alcohol burn on the finish but otherwise the abv hides very well and it's really warming me up.

Black Gold,,Connecticut,4.25/5,"2020 vintage; consumed on 9/18/21

Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon.

Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish.

Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display.","Sep 19, 2021"

Black Gold,,New York,4.11/5,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like roasted malt, spicy oak, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and vanilla.

This is definitely old school in execution - there's lots of roast and spice here. There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness.

This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better.

There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be.","Apr 30, 2021"
Black Gold,,Indiana,4.5/5,"Appearance - The beer poured a fuzzy black color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose was malty bourbon. The booze does not dominate. There was a nice malty presence. 

Taste - this was like barrel aged chocolate malt. The profile was well balanced. It was like chocolate malt, but it was not too boozy. Darker chocolate emerged at the finish. 

Mouthfeel - The lower carbonation allowed chocolate to linger. 

Overall - The chocolatey goodness lingered nicely.","Dec 31, 2020"
Black Gold,,Kentucky,4.4/5,"Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold.

And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived.

Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness.","Dec 28, 2020"

Black Gold,,Illinois,4.69/5,"Had on tap. Void of nothingness black with a brown head. Sweeter nose than I was expecting: maple, chocolate, vanilla with contrasting powerful oak, robust malts, coffee grounds, char, and lingering licorice and earth. Taste leans much more on the robust elements, but has great melding of the flavors from the smell in a foreboding way. Massive and complex. Body is full and chewy, but not overly heavy, great wood textures and smoky earthiness within the booze. Well worth the search, an amazing stout that does not need adjuncts to thrill","Dec 06, 2019"

Yields a night black color with a smaller mohagony colored head.

The aromas lead with ground coffee, honey dipped milk chocolate and matured, spicy wood. There is a leathery quality in this, accompanied by lighter licorice and a note of caramel.

Mouthfeel on this is rich, heavier bodied with a well fitting, lower level of carbonation, which manages to unfold a late effervescence.

Taste offers strong notes of bitter chocolate, roasted espresso beans, dried figs and a well nuanced amount of rich sweet chestnut honey. Reveals an intriguing creaminess then with additional camp fire smoke on top, blending well into the bitter chocolate maltiness in this, together with a lighter note of caramel and mansion dust. Finishes with a lingering herb dryness, blending well into the coffee and chocolate bitterness in this, intensified by the warming, spicy and gnarly oak of the beer.

Fantastic, complex and intense with a great balance to it. This is as good as it gets regarding this style of beer with a beautiful, carefully way of crafting a complex, yet elegant beer.","Dec 19, 2022"

25cl capped bottle into a Side Project snifter. 

Pours a thin mocha colored head. Beer is dense and dark. Super thick, rich, and oily legs that stick around forever. Ditto the head. Nose is sweet soy sauce, anise, prunes, other dried dark fruit, chocolate, roasted malt, and bittersweet cocoa powder. Classic RIS profile. Great complexity. Beer opens chocolate, sweet soy sauce, and semi-sweet cocoa powder. A second sip yields prunes, raisin, and anise in the front and lactose and sweet cream in the middle. Roasted malt and more dark fruit at the finish. Nothing stands out but this is perfectly balanced and the flavors complement each other completely. Body is full with low carbonation. Soft and chewy on the palate and goes down rich, silky, and subtle. Long lingering aftertaste. 

As with the classic whales in their respective styles, this one doesn't stand out for outrageous flavors. Instead, it stands tall for the incredible balance in both the flavor and feel. Just really a perfect beer in the style.","Oct 08, 2014"

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,,Virginia,4.59/5,"I don't review often. But when I do, it's Alexandria Whaelz. HUGE thanks to Bill A for sharing this. Drank along side the non barreled version. Bottle from 2007.

A - Very dark brown, bordering on completely black. Medium tan head that lingers for awhile. I should have used a different glass, I'm an idiot.

S - Not a ton going on here. A good amount of roast, some oaky vanilla notes that come in secondary. As the bottle warmed up, I got the ""Burgundy pepper"" as described below.

T - Strap in. The roast is all up front until an amazing mocha blast in the mid palate. The ending is some vanilla and barrel. There is a slight earthy pepper type of thing going on during the finish. The only time I have experienced something similar is in a handful of other barrel aged beers and in aged red Burgundy's. It's awesome though. 

M - Rich and creamy without bogging down the beer at all. Intensely drinkable for the barrel and style and ABV. Zero alcohol on the back end.

O - This was amazing. It's been one of my top wants for years and I wasn't sure I'd ever get a chance to try it. To be able to do it back to back with the regular version really showcases what the barrel does to this beer. It truly is a shame that this beer is so incredibly limited and expensive.

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,,Illinois,4.69/5,"2007 bottle, generously shared by Sean9869, thanks for letting me try a super long time want.

The beer pours a dark cola brown, nearly black color with swirls of brown, caramel and hazelnut before it all melds together with a slight head that recedes quickly and leaves spots of lace. The aroma is wonderful, wood, char, light chocolate, slightly roasted coffee and toasted grain, sweet alcohol, pitted stone fruit, toffee, molasses, every time I took a sniff, I felt like there was something new, exceedingly complex. The beer really shined on the tongue, bakers chocolate, stone fruit, coffee, barrel character, toffee, mollasses, marshmallow, alcohol and then some, just like the nose, each sip brought out something new and something exciting. The balance is spectacular, the complexity is unending, and the smoothness is hardly matched. The body was great, coats the mouth well, super smooth, rich, decadent without being taxing or too thick.

Verdict: Magnificent, easily the most complex and rewarding RIS I've tried to date and the wood only complimented this further. One of the few beers that has really lived up to the crazy hype, and even exceeded it. Well done Närke.","Jun 05, 2013"

S: The smell is woody, oaky, on vanilla, bourbon and chocolate. Rich and gourmet scene.

Smell: Lightly charred oak, grainy roast malt, a hint of black strap molasses, faint cocoa powder notes, and a touch of floral heather.

Taste: Lightly charred oak, grainy roast malt, dash of alcohol, brewing salts, and a dash of vanilla.


Mouthfeel: Really nice thick body. Just shy of syrupy. Rib sticking and satisfying with moderate carbonation.

A little oxidized. A lot of the honey, sherry qualities brought on by age. Beneath: assloads of butterscotch, toasted oak, dark chocolate. A little licorice. 

Smoother flavor. Big tangy chocolate notes, some sherry, honey. The swallow brings a blend of bourbon, roast and cocoa that's impossible to separate. So. Smooth.

Medium-light, a little thinner than expected. Light tingles of carbonation.

Past its prime for sure. Still went down far too easily.","Nov 21, 2012"

This is almost a religious experience being able to finally try Kaggen. Pours an intense dark hue with a two inch brown head and good lacing. Immediately get a big whiff of chocolate, vanilla and oak. Very aromatically pleasing. The taste follows the nose with roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. Just a wonderfully smooth integration of all the elements as you sip on this and it feels as great in the mouth as going down. The worst part about this beer is that it comes to an end after 25cl.

Can’t believe I FINALLY got to try this one!!! 2008 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured pitch black with a minimal tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wood, dark chocolate, vanilla, sweet alcohol, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, sweet alcohol, and milk chocolate. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. This was another one that I was shocked to see come out at the birthday party. This was sampled directly after Stormaktsporter. There was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew. There was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects. The cigar aspect I picked up on in the base brew had disappeared, but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent. So glad I got the chance to finally try this one and would love to do so over and over again.","May 31, 2012"
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,,District of Columbia,4.85/5,"Shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks a lot, Brad! Served alongside Stormaktsporter.

2009 vintage

The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter.

A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze.

The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony.

Highly recommended, should you have the good fortune to sample this.","May 29, 2012"
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,,Greece,5/5,"250ml Bottle First try in 2009 a 2006 Vintage. I can’t deny that I had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fulfill them. Did it ? Hell yeah ! 2006 Bottle, served in a wonderful De Molen snifter. It pours pitch black, thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head. The wonderful roasted aroma, with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla, tar and wood. So complex and as it warms it becomes even better But nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow. The roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood notes, some distant ripe fruit. So many flavors , so wonderfully balanced together. What really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite it’s ABV, you feel like you can have (in my dreams) many many glasses, which is rarely the case with big Imp stouts. I can’t give it anything but a perfect score and I really doubt that I will do this for another beer (certainly hope so though :D ). 

Having had this on many more occasions and in many vintages, my original rating hasn’t changed a bit. i wish I could drink this every day.","May 15, 2012"
Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,,Illinois,4.88/5,"Bought a bottle of 2008 in September 2011 at Akkurat in Stockholm, Sweden. 

A: Not as dark as I expected. Dark brown but thick, almost viscous. This looks like it will be a real mouthful.

Smell: Can't smell any of the alcohol.. Recovering from a cold but I know I can't smell alcohol but my senses are slightly muted. I get hints of chocolate, perhaps vanilla? 

T: Excellent.. Even though I'm sick, this beer is drinking fantastic. I brought a KBS and the KBS in taste cannot stand up to the complexity of this beer.

Mouthfeel: Feels exactly like it looks. A real heavy swisher.

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,,Nevada,4.73/5,"Usual black color for a stout, but the thick dark tan head and the clumpy lace made for a treat in the appearance department. Aroma was very nice as well, well integrated bourbon notes with soft malt roasting, chocolate/chocolate malt. Pair that with a mild oak and leather in the aroma, a very nice beer already.

Taste, wow, beautiful, hides the alcohol well, the bourbon barrel like notes don't dominate, nothing dominates, is extremely easy to drink, especially for the heft of the alcohol. A mild smooth sweetness, almost honey like along with faint vanilla. Mouthfeel not overly thick, allows every component of the beer to come out oh so nicely. One of the more rare things for a barrel aged stout to do is allow for a caramel smoothness to help out, and this one does just that. Its not all about being the biggest and most abrasive peeps! 

One of the best bal stouts in the world. Thanks to jh1982, dsgolovin & largadeer for putting together a combo of beers outside of Triple Rock for me and the ladyfriend to join in sampling, best beers of the weekend (well actually 2012 so far).","Feb 16, 2012"

Beyond Good And Evil,,Massachusetts,4.56/5,"L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half
S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout
T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected

Beyond Good And Evil,,Nevada,4.29/5,"This is a review of the 2015 version that was on tap in October 2019 @ Hill Farmstead. 

Pours black, 1/3"" brown head. Aroma reveals that both the coffee and maple have melded/faded into the bourbon notes. I like that sweet spot where things gel more than being led by one dominant aspect generally. Equal parts.

Taste, oh shit, now we're about to get heavenly up in here. This is why sometimes you ignore that ""drink fresh"" notion. Fresh maple dominates seeming too sweet sometimes, fresh coffee just dominates and that is largely all you taste. But here, 4 years later, you get this full fledged bourbon accentuated with maple and coffee. Again, the notion of equal parts, but it tastes even better than it smells. Of course the damn mouth feel is silky and luxurious, the maple seems to be best here, smoothing out double digit abv into a delight to drink, never oppressive, hot, bitter etc. . .

Some hazelnut and brown sugar as well. Pretty incredible how much it smells like the dessert. Beer opens chocolate, vanilla, and sweet cream. Hazelnut shell and ash.

Barrel throughout that becomes more prominent as this one warms. This is delicious! Body is medium with low carbonation. Smooth and somehow soft on the palate. Sticky and boozy going down with a long, lingering aftertaste. I'm usually a fan of heavier bodies but somehow this works perfectly. 

I'm a couple of years behind the hype here but these Angry Chair adjunct stouts have been incredible. The nose and flavors are perfect.","Feb 19, 2023"

Lots of chocolate fudge. It literally smells like the ice cream flavour would. A mild amount of whiskey as well, but the nose is primarily chocolate fudge, in the most authentic way possible. Flavour is Rocky Road ice cream with a shot of bourbon poured over it. That's pretty much all there is to it- the vanilla/marshmallow adds a nice counter sweetness to the chocolate fudge, cocoa and the nuttiness adds a nice dimension on top.

Taste: again, mind blown. It's hot fudge sundae in a glass. Its really hard to get more specific than that. So chocolatey and sweet with marshmallows, vanilla ice cream, and walnuts. At room temperature the bourbon became more noticeable as well as the walnuts. Not much alcohol warmth until the very finish. Some beers in the market are so sickly sweet however this beer makes the exception; while its sweet, its unique flavors are balanced and easy to appreciate.

The smell really nails the inspiration at first as walnut collides with marshmallow and a toasty roasty chocolate. However, notes of charred barrel bring with them an almost funky, musty wood that's nutty with age and waxiness.

Flavor is a dessert wasteland. Waffle cone stuffed with melty marshmallow fluff pocked by walnut dotted chocolate fudge and marzipan.

Pours nearly pitch black and still, with just a small layer of tan bubbles than quickly fade to a thin ring that leaves no lacing but nice legs

While I appreciate this not having the typical TH Stout sweetness in the nose, it’s not as complex as I had hoped though still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and raisin

It is sweet in taste, but not in any cloying way, rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, plum, vanilla, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, black cherry, and burnt caramel. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, boozy bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, black cherry, pecan, toasted oak, and dark roast coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sweet beer. Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet

Truth,,New Hampshire,4.83/5,"750 ml bottle.

Gentle pour brings a pure jet black motor oil color with a finger of caramel head. Good retention for the style. Leaves a halo of lacing around the glass. Settles into a thin film laid carefully across the beer.

The aroma brings strong notes of bourbon, dark fruits, caramel, dark chocolate, and pecans with loads of vanilla, oak, toffee, dark roast coffee beans, light char and a bit of smoke.

The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies. There's loads of Hazelnut coffee, toasted pecans and almonds, as well as bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, plum and caramel. Boozy but at 12.3% this should be expected. A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together.

The feel is full bodied, chewy and syrupy. Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze, as expected.

Overall, I might be a Tree House fanboy but I've been quite critical of their stouts in recent years. They've become a bit too sweet with minimal balance. Just chocolate syrup. This bad boy, however, is one of the rare barrel aged stouts they have. Fortunately, I didn't pay anything for the beer as the bottle was shared with a friend.

This is definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. The bourbon is certainly present, but doesn't overpower the beer like other BA stouts. It's sweet, but nowhere near cloying. Boozy, but not overly so.","May 12, 2022"

Review #2100

Medium bodied dark brown/black appearance. Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated. The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly, cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart. A medium sized halo encircled the liquid.

The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle. Malty notes dominated. Roasted malts were most apparent. Good dose of caramel malt character too. Moderately sweet. Slightly smoky. Almost a touch peaty. Dark fruits were also detectable. Raisins, plums and figs perhaps. There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well, but this subsided with time. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified. The dark fruits, the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier.

The flavor profile followed the nose. Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts. Slightly smoky. Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate. Port soaked raisins came to mind. There was a bit of a chocolate/Tootsie Roll-like character too. Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end, but they dissipated with time. More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish.

The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude. Smooth and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.

Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts, but their purely barrel-aged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel. While this was an enjoyable beer, it did little to stand apart from the pack.","Jun 28, 2021"

Truth,,Massachusetts,4.67/5,"Enjoyed at the 3rd Anniversary Party at the brewery. Reviewed from notes. 

A - Poured into the custom Tree House wine glass a dark, oily brownish black hue with a one finger mocha head that fades to leave light wisps. BIG legs on this beer.

S - Aromas of bourbon upon bourbon upon bourbon. Did I say this has lots of bourbon? So much so that it actually overpowers the stout a bit. That rich fudgy chocolate is beaten into submission by the big, sweet bourbon notes. That being said, for all the bourbon characteristics this nose has, it doesn't exactly have a harsh nose. All the more shocking by the ABV.

T - Taste is absolutely phenomenal. LOADS of bourbon, which...one should expect at this point. The sweet caramel, vanilla, and soft, woody barrel notes eventually give way to some extremely fudgy chocolate. The stout itself is almost lightly fruity. Man oh man are the big chocolate notes and big bourbon notes balanced here.

M - Mouthfeel is creamy, very creamy. Alcohol hidden incredibly well. 

O - Overall, this beer was absolutely incredible. Hands down the best beer of the day. Little things prevent 5's....the appearance, could have better head retention. On the nose, the bourbon certainly could stand to be less aggressive. The taste, a touch more chocolate would be nice. Mouthfeel could be a bit less heavy. Very, very well crafted for sure, but for me not really warranting 5's across the board by any means. Damn, I sound like JLindros now...

Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla.

And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts.

Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate.","Jan 19, 2022"

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,New Jersey,4.29/5,"Pours dark and a bit on the thin side. Thin head fades quite quickly. Big maple syrup aroma, followed by chocolate and coffee. Barrel aroma is faint. Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup; cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee. Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms. The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately. Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness. Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it. Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this.

-Enjoying this fine porter on release day (01/25/2020). Poured straight from the bottle into a tulip glass. 

-Shallow pour shows a nice brown color. Appears black and turbid in a full glass but the nice brown color remains on the edges. Head is a nice light brown, which died down pretty quickly. Not very much lacing. 

-Very sweet smelling maple and boozy bourbon. Those are the only scents I'm getting. Not smelling any coffee really.

-Tastes exactly as it smells. Strong maple and bourbon flavor but that's about it. Would be lying if I said I tasted coffee. Pure bourbon and maple flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it feels pretty different from the original Sunday brunch. One thing worth noting though is that it doesn't taste as boozy as it smells. The alcohol is hidden very well. Would not have guessed it was 11%.

-Mouth feel is near-perfect. Not as thick as I would have expected but surely far from watery. Perfect amount of carbonation. 

-Overall, I think this beer is absolutely delicious and deserves its highly acclaimed status. That being said, I would definitely like if there was a bit more coffee flavor to it, as that is one of my favorite aspects of the original Sunday brunch. Is it worth the price? Debatable. But its damn good and I would definitely recommend it to any porter/stout lover. 5/5.","Jan 25, 2020"

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Ohio,4.49/5,"Even after time in the barrel, the appearance is similar to regular Sunday Brunch, with that classic coffee black that's a bit shinier, and a densely tall mocha foam that slowly settles to a creamy ring.

Smell is certainly boozier up front, but taste is still mostly that same old classic Sunday Brunch, which is no complaint at all. But starting with aroma, where it's more barrel forward, the peppery bourbon enhances the maple with its own maple-esque accents, as all the sticky cinnamon frosting and slightly smoky dark coffee are still delectably present. There's even a touch of candy corn I sometimes get from drinking straight bourbon.

Much like BA Mexican Brunch, the barrel is hard to detect up front, but as it warms and as you sit with it, the warming swallow begins to bring in some contrasts. The cinnamon is slightly dusty but earthy and brown sugary, while the bourbon is a little smoky and is nicely complimented by the coffee before a slight numbing, peppery sting comes in on the way down.

The full body has a solid froth that feels substantially satisfying before a semi-dry swallow.

I could drink Kane’s dark beers all day every day forever. I'd give up pretty much any other beer to have access to their stuff on the regular.

In early 2022 I enjoyed a 2021 bottle, in which I found that all elements actually seem subdued in pursuit of more balance towards the barrel character, which adds vanillin and a touch of warmth while enhancing the maple--often the most elusive element of SB.

Huuuuuge thanks to rudzud

Pours a giant mocha colored foamy thick rich 1 finger head that fades slowly, plenty of lacing and great legs, pitch black beer, for the abv there is no way that gets any better!

Nose is incredible, just incredible, rich dark chocolate cocoa, a little nutty, a bit of coffee as well, tons of cinnamon, spicy almost hot cinnamon, nice vanilla, some barrel notes and a bit of bourbon and a little maple, maybe the only thing keeping it from a 5 is the lack of bourbon, some baking spices and a little tobacco, little fudgey nougat and marshmallowy thing

Taste brings more of the awesomeness, sweet rich dark malts, tons of cocoa and dark chocolate, into big cinnamon, lots of rich vanilla as well, cocoa, little coffee roast, back into big baking spices with the cinnamon, and again that mild tobacco with a touch of char, into barrel, not a ton but a really nice barrel, a little barrel, a bit of maple but not a ton, great vanilla and lush creamy cocoa, a touch of bitterness, chocolate sauce, finishing a bit more bitter, little roast and coffee, plenty more lingering fudge vanilla, some coconut late esp the burps

Mouth is full bod, rich creamy fairly lush, decent carb, no alcohol, just not quite velvety enough to be a 5 but very close

The star of the beer is the aroma. The perfect amalgamation of maple, cinnamon, cafe au lait and dark chocolate. Its spectacular.

Bottle to wine glass at daughters communion party. Oh, this was so worth the trouble to get this.

LOOK: dark black, not quite syrupy, but thick, with a healthy off white head. 
AROMA: coffee, maple, chocolate, bourbon; all in equal parts.
TASTE: Someone chocolate covered the best piece of french toast in the world, then soaked it into bourbon and then dissolved it into this super tasty porter. WOW! Notes of coffee, caramel, vanilla, oatmeal, brown sugar all play around throughout the pour. simply wonderful. Yum.
FEEL: smooth as silk. full bodied. touch of carbonation. 

Oh My! This is the best beer I have ever tasted. It is so well balanced between sweet and savory, light and thick, boozy yet smooth. No aftertaste, side effects, astringency, sourness, bitterness or anything off. As close to perfection as I have witnessed in beer.

This one pours the expected dark black, with a small head and not much lacing.

The maple on this is so decadent, dark and rich- it just assaults the nose. There's lots of chocolate, deep bourbon barrel character, spicy oak, and creamy fruity coffee.

This is just so carefully built and thought out. It's a maple bomb, but it's still pretty complex. The barrel adds a lot to the base beer. The bourbon adds some earthy sweetness, and the oak adds some spiciness- keeping this from being too sweet. There's lots and lots of fudgy chocolate, a bit of coffee, and cinnamon sweetness that reminds me of cinnamon vanilla icing.

Gggreennn!,,Germany,4.31/5,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy, slightly muddy yellow with a stable foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. A few floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh citrus fruits and pineapple. Green and a bit dank.

Taste: Green hops and fresh fruits. Citrusy (lemon and orange) and tropical (pineapple and guava). Some hints of sweetness and a zesty, very bitter finish.

Feel: Juicy and quite crushable. Medium carbonation and some sharp notes.

Overall: As much as I prefer Very Green over Green, I prefer Very Gggreennn over Gggreennn. Sounds confusing, but this one tastes just a bit too green for me. It's still a very nice brew with the typical Tree House characteristics.","Apr 05, 2022"

Gggreennn!,,Massachusetts,4.68/5,"I wish I had both Very Green and this and could go back and forth to compare. Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do?

Some of the pineapple carries over to the taste, but there’s a lot more lime, white pepper and pithy bitterness here. A little orange juice peaks out under the pith every once in a while in the aftertaste.

Full bodied and slick with strong carbonation.

Nose is mostly tropical - papaya and passionfruit juice, along with spent grain. A hint of spicy alcohol as well as it warms. Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full.

Hazy, for sure. Nice fluffy head, great retention.
The nose bursts with guava, followed by orange zest, melon, mango, pineapple and, well, green notes.
The flavor jumps off with the citrus first. Zesty orange, creamy tangerine, mango, slightly sweet gritty grain note (in a great way), and a fine line between juicy and a gentle bitterness. But overall, a very smooth ride allowing for all of these flavors to take a turn in the limelight.
The mouthfeel is fluffy, medium weight, with a good carbonation level. A smooth bitterness closes it down.

Gggreennn!,,Connecticut,4.45/5,"Hazy, opaque, pulpy; it's a classic Tree House IPA, along with excellent head production and lacing, and nice retention. Body is right between lemon-yellow and orange.

Would it surprise you to hear that this beer is, well, hoppy on the nose? Very bright and fresh: orange, tangerine, mango, and bright green herbs. Absolutely bursting. Reminds me of classic TG hop bombs, but without any of the dirtiness.

A touch lighter on the palate than the hops on the nose implied. Pineapple, tangerine, lemon, grapefruit peel (primarily on the finish), mango.

Smooth and creamy on the palate, although not quite as full bodied as some of their other IPAs. Consistent with their brand, there is plenty of bitterness alongside the bursting juiciness, along with a bright and semi-dry finish, really readying you for the next sip. No hop burn or astringency.

Tree House are among the leaders of the NE IPA sub-style for a reason. They hop these beers to high heaven in all phases, yet always avoid any burn. The hops are juicy and fruity, but they resist the urge to stick to late- and dry-hopping, completely avoiding the 0-IBU race. The mouthfeel is always smooth and creamy, evoking the Vermont masters who first stood out in that fashion. The result: incredible consistency; juicy, drinkable beers that are still identifiable as IPAs (or as beers, period, in this modern landscape); IPAs that, no matter how many you've had, never fail to impress and deliver.","Oct 02, 2021"

Nothing overpowering, and all the aromas feel like they're integrated into the beer, rather than an adjunct or flavoring that's thrown in on top and feels ""artificial."" Taste follows - it lacks the overpowering leathery and brackish boldish of Black Tuesday, but the cocoa additional doesn't tilt this sweet. Instead, it takes some of the rougher edges off BT while still maintaining an overall ""savory"" (or at least, no sweet) stout. Lots of alcohol, barrel, and bourbon spice lingers nicely on the loooong finish. Plenty of heat as well, but again, not overpowering.

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better","Aug 19, 2022"

Like with all the other Weekday pours, a dark brown color with crimson hues. Small amounts of ivory head that dissipates quickly and settles into the beer. 

Dark fruit and booze right away on the nose, with hints of roasty coffee and vanilla. Lots of potent ethanol, with those expected notes of oak and char from the Black Tuesday's sweet, smooth base character. Although there's that high gravity potency, even after 3 years of bottle conditioning, both adjuncts are still very much present.

The vanilla and chocolate have held up so well in the flavors. If you have a bottle of this from 2015, now is the time to open it. Predominantly sweet, with complimentary hints of dark fruit and subtle roasty coffee. Balanced, smooth flavors. Baker’s chocolate bitterness contrasts a sweet vanilla bean finish. 

Smooth and the softest mouthfeel of all the other Weekday variants. Warm, boozy, with low carbonation that is still present but not at all distracting.","Dec 30, 2018"
Chocolate Rain,,Michigan,4.46/5,"Pours Brown. Foamy, short tan had that lasts a little. Color is surprisingly light.

Smells bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel and chocolate.

Taste roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit hints, and caramel. Lots of barrel character it should be called bourbon rain instead. Finishes dry with a roasted and bourbon linger. Lighter medium body and lightly fizzy medium carbonation. Flavor is not as sweet as I was expecting but tastes amazing. The body was surprisingly thin though.","Nov 24, 2018"
Chocolate Rain,,Massachusetts,4.44/5,"02/2015 - 2013 vintage - Wow, this is exactly what I wanted from this Black Tuesday variant; the chocolate takes it to the next level - big fan! The mouthfeel is even better, too.","Sep 27, 2018"

Double Nelson,,Texas,4.9/5,"#162, great stuff!","May 03, 2023"
Double Nelson,,New York,4.2/5,"From notes. Pours a hazed out light-medium yellow, light ring of head but solid enough streaky lacing. Nose strikes a good balance between juicier, tropical fruit (mango, passionfruit) and deeper, danker, more resinous aromas that prevent it from tilting overly tacky and sweet. Taste follows to strike a middle ground between dank and sweet with a trace of spice on the finish, all while hiding any hint of alcohol. Mouthfeel is rather soft. One of the better HF offerings I've had.","Mar 28, 2023"

T: Strawberries, white grapes, pineapple and mango. Medium sweet, medium bitter and slightly tart. Grassy and herbal.

F: Soft and juicy with a smooth drinkability. Medium carbonation.

O: Just what you'd expect from an all Nelson IPA by HF. Nicely balanced, very complex and and highly drinkable. Not overpowering in any way. Just an overall great beer.","Jan 31, 2023"
Double Nelson,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Pours a beautifully hazy golden straw color with a dense, creamy white head that leaves little space on the glass. Gorgeous hazy. The nose is that ubiquitous Nelson Sauvin profile, with dank passion fruit, green grapes (or white wine, if you prefer), and sweet berry aromas triggering the salivary glands.

The dank passion fruit and grape flavors are forward on the taste, with the sweet berry flavors following for an exceptionally flavorful, balanced beer that drinks way too easily for an 8% ABV beer.

A full, slightly creamy mouthfeel contributes to this magnificent beer’s drinkability. World class beer from a world class brewery.","Jan 14, 2023"
Double Nelson,,New York,4.6/5,"On tap at Fool’s Gold NYC, this beer lived up to the hype. Poured cloudy gold orange color, fading very slowly and leaving really fine rings of foamy lacing. It smelled like ripe oranges and grapefruit ripped open, with lemon zest, tangerine and a whole array of citrus fruit rising from the glass before each sip. I had 4 over the course of a few hours and it was very smooth feeling, with spot on carbonation and a high level of bitterness that added to the taste complexities. Basically the flavor was like grapefruit juice and orange juice with hop cones floating in it; it was dank and juicy, with enough grassy hop spices and malty aspects to add balance to the citrus onslaught. This was really enjoyable.","Oct 27, 2022"
Double Nelson,,Massachusetts,4.46/5,"On tap at Armsby Abbey

Alright, once again, Armsby Abbey is hooking it up with some truly legendary beer. They always seem to have the craziest stuff, and always a damn good selection from Hill Farmstead. I’ve seen this one on the menu from time to time, but never manage to make it up in time to try it, so naturally I had to grab it when I saw it on today’s menu. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is bright and enticing, but still carries a nice sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of lime zest, bready malt, cantaloupe, floral hops, gooseberry, light white wine, and white pepper

It matches the intensity in taste, really striking a nice balance. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting orange juice, lime zest, crackery malt, gooseberry, earthy hops, light honey, toasted grain, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of white grape, bready malt, floral hops, cantaloupe, pine sap, gooseberry, light lime, and honey

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet creamy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries over time

Wow, this one is unique. Nelson is not a hop I really tend go enjoy usually, but this is just a wonderful expression of it. I gotta get my ass up to Hill Farmstead one of these days","Oct 15, 2022"
Double Nelson,,Massachusetts,4.56/5,"Another phenomenal single hopped DIPA from Hill Farmstead. Probably the best exhibition of Nelson I've had -- tons of cattiness and white grape, with a nice tropical sorbet note in the back. Soft, light bitterness, pale malt doughy sweetness... a joy to drink

Double Nelson,,New Hampshire,4.46/5,"16oz can dated 9/15/21.

Pours hazy gold with a half inch head of white. Moderate retention and lacing. Dank, wild grapes in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft but crisp mouthfeel. Juicy, resinous citrus on the palate with minimal malt and a medium bitterness. Pineapple, white grapes, and papaya. Finishes fairly dry but juicy and wildly dank.","Oct 21, 2021"
Double Nelson,,Maine,4.43/5,"Immense thank you to jrc1093 for this one. I've always wanted to try this little Kiwi bastard. 

12oz can - dated 10/06/20 - poured into an ale stem at 40°F.

Pours a fully hazed, but just shy of milky peach flesh yellow, topped with a large finger of off-white foamy head with good retention, leaving a tall collar of lacing as it recedes. No visible effervescence through the haze. 

Nose: Instantly recognisable as a Nelson single hop IPA. Green, grassy, herbal notes of cut grass, unripe horned melon rind, lime leaf, white grape, passionfruit, feijoa, lychee, leafy, vegetal wild herbs, unripe pineapple, unripe mango, orange zest, and a peppery twinge.

Palate: As expected, this greets the palate with the same Nelson intensity as on the nose. Horned melon, acidic pineapple, white grape, unripe mango, passionfruit, lychee, kumquat, and unripe melon rind, shifting into some greener notes of lime leaf, lime zest, fresh cut grass, and a vegetal, planty root note - green, and slightly earthy. This shifts into oily, resinous, leafy territory, before taking on a very distinct lime zest note. The beer finishes with this lingering lime zest, complete with a firm pithy bitterness, and showing some pale, flakey malt underneath. 

Mouthfeel/Body: For the higher ABV, this drinks wonderfully. All the 8% flavor saturation, but remains crisp, fluid, and drinkable. It still has that soft, fluffy New England texture, but it's never sticky, sappy, or heavy. Effervescence is moderate, but very fine, lending a nice fuzziness. There's that signature racey Hill minerality to it, which compliments a wonderful touch of hop acidity. 

Overall: A truly fantastic display of Nelson - so on-point, it almost serves as a Nelson caricature, in the best possible way. Densely saturated, green, leafy, and vegetal, with all the uniqueness inherent to Nelson. The base beer is so classically Hill Farmstead, which only serves to elevate the experience with an impressive display of quality and craftsmanship. Balanced, polished, and refined, shining everywhere you could want a Hill IPA to shine.","Oct 30, 2020"

Double Nelson,,Connecticut,4.43/5,"Canned on 10/6/20

Pours an opaque, dark sunflower gold body capped with two fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; great head retention yields a rocky, thin cap, an expansive, frothy collar, and layers of ringed, webby lacing spread uniformly around the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens with profoundly ripe notes of fresh grass and vegetal/herbal root, given further definition via accents of green grape skins and sweet lime merengue; tangerine brings a citric depth over the middle as white grape must encroaches beneath; peppery melon, creamy mango, and pithy pineapple all contribute varying tropical and earthy touches interspersed throughout the back end and close of the bouquet.

Taste shows huge notes of oily, resinous, underripe mango with light accents of white grape must for a balanced initial impression; clementine, tangerine, and underripe lychee soon mark the mid-palate as the increasingly herbal qualities of cantaloupe rind, lime zest, and straw bring an about an earthy finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body accompanied with a moderate carbonation enabling a fluffy prickle beautifully timed across the mid-palate with a residual, evenly dispersed, and subtle resin; flaky malts beneath a delicate hop acidity peak into a silky back end as a juicy finish 'pops' against an ever-present moderate bitterness.

Nelson hops in-focus and refined to near-extremes, the steady malt base levels what becomes a truly fantastic all-around hop composition, so relentlessly poised and yet somehow never underwhelming; the comprehensive structure of the Hill Farmstead DIPA is on full display once more with this brew.","Oct 23, 2020"

Double Nelson,,New York,4.5/5,"A huge thanks to GrumpyOldTroll for this one. 

12oz. can into Night Shift stemware. 

Nose is pineapple, kiwi, pear and apple. There's a slight citrus fruit zing with copious amounts of cane sugar and a touch of creaminess. Nice and balanced with a great fruit bouquet. Beer opens dank papaya, pineapple, lychee and pear. Some mango in the middle with an awesome pulpiness that finishes cane sugar, more lychee, pear and apple. Absolutely delicious. Body is light with moderate to ample carbonation. Soft and pillowy on the palate and goes down bone dry with a dry, lingering aftertaste. It doesn't get more drinkable than this. 

I'm actually surprised that Hill Farmstead finally started to can their IPAs. That being said, I'm glad because it really is a gift to the masses who are able to get their hands on this.","Feb 06, 2020"

Taste has the same flavors but the malt meets them all in a dry cracker way, the combination gives the beer a dry, resinous, and elevated finish. Smell delivers more on the promise of the hops.

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,,Michigan,4.77/5,"Brief Review:

O: ""Holy shit, this beer is good."" That was my first thought. I honestly didn't go into this with much expectation other than I knew I'd at leas like it since it's TG and a Sue beer. I didn't love PseudoSue, nor the Galaxy Dry-Hopped version. Thought they were just okay, and potentially over-hyped. Haven't had either in several years. But once I cracked this, I could tell right away it was special. Haze-bomb in the glass. Huge pineapple and mango aromas. Mouthfeel and finish is super rich and juicy. This is honestly up there with some of the Tree House hazy's I had back in the day. Also didn't know this was a Top 150 beer until I looked it up, and I have to say, it's deserves every ounce of the praise.

Recommendation: A surprisingly great extra hoppy edition of the classic PseudoSue. This is by far the best in the line, must-try and not terribly hard to get either.","May 24, 2023"

Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,,Wisconsin,4.13/5,"Canned 3/27/23 (1 month ago)

Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (0% clarity) medium and pale golden color with a massive white head. SRM of 7. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of lemon citrus, lemon flower with more pale malts and sweet lemon that lingers. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of lemon citrus, lemon flower, pale malts. Hoppy lemon citrus notes linger, yet without a burn and soft. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied, strong carbonation. A smooth and soft finish. (4.00) 

Compared to TG Pseudo Sue 4/2023: Pours light and more pale, similar head. Stronger aromas. More lemon citrus sweetness. Less pale malts. More hoppy, but also less smooth.

Overall: A ramped up version of the original Pseudo Sue. Both are absolutely fantastic. This one is remarkable for the same great flavors as the original, yet has even more lemon citrus hop flavors. Still a smooth mouthfeel, but not quite as drinkable as the original version. I would describe it as Pseudo Sue, but in an IPA format rather than a pale ale. Both are World-Class.

Taste: Quite contrary to the smell, citrus notes are dominating here with tropical pineapple and mango in the background. Medium sweetness with a slightly bitter, minimally zesty finish.

Feel: Fresh, juicy and quite full. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Full and fragrant pale ale that tastes somehow exactly as you‘d want a double dry hopped 6.8 ABV version of Pseudo Sue to taste. One of the best pale ales I‘ve had and quite rightly a top ten beer in this category.","May 04, 2022"

Wet straw color, completely opaque. Lots of very fine white head, with lots of lacing.

All sorts of citrus on the nose. Red grapefruit, acidic orange, touches of lime. Moderately sweet malt. Marshmallows. It strikes a really nice balance.

The fruits are dialed back in the taste, and there's more of a vegetation/leafy flavor up front. Mild bitterness. Tart sweetness shows up a bit late, right there with the citrus. The flavors are notably sharp, too. (And this particular can was brewed five weeks ago.)

Aftertaste is bitter, but it's a dull bitterness. Very nicely integrated carbonation, and it's one of the finest I've run across. Medium weight.","Mar 15, 2022"

Double Shot,,Indiana,4.42/5,"Appearance - The beer poured a silky black color with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. 

Smell - the nose had a strong coffee presence with noted sweetness.

Taste -There was a lot of coffee here. Notes of chocolate syrup, and light vanilla we’re also present. It was not overly sweet to the point of being calling and allowing the coffee to shine. The coffee and chocolate continued in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was slick and not overly thick with small bubbles.

Overall - This is a great stout that coffee stout lovers will love.","Aug 13, 2023"
Double Shot,,Pennsylvania,4.36/5,"I usually like to sample a base beer before dipping into variants. However, when it comes to TH, I take what I can get when I can get it. So, I tried the Espresso version of this beer before sampling the OG version that is before me now.

Pours a deep dark brown-to-black color with over a finger of head that is milk chocolate in color. Like the Espresso variant, I am not overly impressed by the nose - some coffee, not much else.

The flavor profile is dominated by fresh black coffee. The bitterness off the roasted beans is the highlight here. The body is hearty and the finish has just enough residual sweetness to counteract the bitter coffee.","Jul 24, 2023"

Heavy body; heavy sweetness throughout with a mild dryness at the finish.

Double Shot,,Connecticut,4.29/5,"Look...A black viscous motor oil with a vibrant chocolaty wealth of big and little bubbles of light brown
Smell...A rich chocolate and coffee but faint with a malt back. Molasses and hint of alcohol
Taste...A rich roasty chocolate malt with almost no hint of coffee. I think that the coffee presence has been quelled or reduced by the nine months on this beer. Anyway a complex sweetness and a bitterness that is definitely overpowered
Feel...I believe the best quality of this beer. A pesky fullness with the 8.2% ABV seemingly heavier to me. To me this is the part of the beer that I fin craft beers are so superior to the huge stout boys like Founders Sierra just to name a few . The local varieties have a creamier touch
Overall...This is a sweet stout. I believe the time on this beer (holding it for science haha) has made this beer sweeter than the normal and a practice I would not do to this beer in the future, Still a well made beer but I like a little more balance of bitter.

Taste is really nice, a larger medium roasted malt base that is enhanced nicely with a dose of espresso. Finished perfectly balanced and no astringency.

Double Shot,,New Hampshire,4.15/5,"From a 16oz can with a ‘Spring 2023’ date stamp which, inasmuch as it’s still early February, puzzles somewhat. Served in a tulip.

Pours an unhighlighted chestnut-black, oily in appearance, with a finger of coffee-colored foam. Retention is on the order of a minute or two, leaving a thin, tattered sheet of lacing.

A pleasantly warm and roasty, mildly sweet nose. Aroma of molasses-sweetened coffee and bakers chocolate. Dreamy.

Taste is utterly in line with the nose, sparing me the trouble of having to think of new words. Molasses-sweetened coffee and bakers chocolate. A dulce de leche, sort of caramelized milk and vanilla character comes forward with the coffee as the beer sits. There’s an oily, prickly tingle throughout which is as much a taste as a feel.

Feel is thick and syrupy, unctuous, heavy bodied with oily, super-fine prickly carbonation.

Overall, overly sweet and syrupy to my tastes. I understand the appeal, I just don’t quite share it. Still, at 8.2% it sure as hell gets the job done, I mean, right?","Feb 10, 2023"

Double Shot,,Massachusetts,4.4/5,"“Stout season“ stamped on the bottom of the can

Oh man, I’m so happy to be here. I’ve been waiting so long for Tree House to re-brew straight up, OG Double Shot. This has been (and is still) the highest rated American Stout on BA for quite a while, I’ve had it marked as a want for nearly 3 years. So, let’s get into another world class Stout

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of dark mocha head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

Oh man, the coffee is so forward in the nose, but there’s still a decent anount of that TH Stout-sweetness still. I’m picking up on aromas of spent coffee beans, espresso, chocolate fudge, caramel, toasted nuts, brown sugar, and light raisin

In taste the sweetness is mostly up front, and it starts to dry off into a slightly more traditional Stout on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting coffee candy, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, vanilla, sweet bourbon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of spent coffee beans, fruity coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, brown bread, raisin, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice roast character

I gotta say, with this newly brewed version of this beer being at 8.2%, I didn’t really think it would be a true American Stout. And is it that? No, not really, but it still retains some old school characteristic, and it’s just damn good regardless. I’m happy to have made a trip up to Tree House mostly for this beer","Jul 31, 2022"
Double Shot,,Michigan,4.53/5,"Sent to me by the one and only @ovaltine whose beer prowess is so amazing he can get fresh Tree House stouts in Indiana.
Poured deep dark, not exactly black but darn near. The head was as dark a brown as I have seen on a beer, the one knock was the head didn’t stay long.
The aroma, mostly I just get vague impressions of aromas as I foolishly didn’t wear a respirator when working with some nasty chemicals. Every once in a while I get more, and those are treats! This one gets me coffee and roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla. Mostly coffee, but wow it’s all in there.
The taste followed, coffee leads and filled the spectrum at first, only swallowing allowed the roasted malts and bourbon (bourbon soaked Madagascar vanilla beans, who knew?) and the vanilla sneaks in last. I enjoyed every sip and it was gone too soon.
The feel was excellent for the sipping nature of this beer, soft almost, counters the nearly bitter coffee presence.
OA, thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now I want to go to the brewery for a vacation. Sadly, my partner said no. If I wanted to stay married that is.","Jul 10, 2022"

Tree House Brewing
Date: 18 June 2021
This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights. 

Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas. 

One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors. The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect 

The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold. 

The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish. 

The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover.","Oct 09, 2021"

Roast, cocoa powder, and a mild nuttiness. Flavor has a moderate bitterness of coffee, roast, and cocoa. However, a nice sweet balance to it. Plenty of caramel and dried blueberry. I liked this more than the maple one.","Feb 05, 2021"
Double Shot,,Maine,4.05/5,"Huge thanks to Alan for this one, and plenty of other long time wants. This is one of those beers you just have to try at least once, so here I go!

Pint can - dated 01/14/20 - poured into a tumbler at 50°F. 

Pours a gleaming jet black - no head, until a two finger coffee bean-coloured head races up, before racing right back down to a still top, looking like tar in the glass. Like nothing I've ever seen. I'll give a 5 to that. 

Nose: Black coffee. Some roasty nuance, such as a hint of caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and even a hint of dark fruit and red wine, but this is essentially sweet coffee.

Palate: Much like the nose, this is an absolute coffee bomb. It opens up quite sweet, with lots of cocoa from the roast, which lends its own coffee character as well. Moderate roast, accentuated by the coffee, but the hearty sweetness wins over. Secondary notes of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and unfortunately, lactose. I knew there was something unpleasant about this - there's clearly lactose in it. The lactose lends this quick spike of this almost aspartame/artificial sweetener flavour just before the finish, where it also extinguishes any sort of roast that may have been. Luckily, there's enough coffee for the more roasty notes of the bean to come through in the finish, which helps to dry it out. 

Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is full-bodied, and has a slick, oily feel to it. In addition to the naturally full body, the lactose definitely adds,some viscosity here, as does the sheer level of sweetness. Major stickiness is left clinging to the lips with this one. Effervescence is actually quite adequate - lower, but very fine and fizzy. 

Overall: All the components of a great coffee stout are here. The beans themself are clearly primo quality, with zero green pepper or stale notes, the base stout is well-crafted, but - it's too sweet, and there's just too much lactose. In fact, if there weren't any lactose, i think it could pull off the sweetness just fine, but with both elements in place, it does become a bit cloying. I do not think the lactose benefits this beer in any way whatsoever. You can easily get that chewy feel without milk sugar, and it ends up tasting more natural. It's still good, it's still drinkable, but I'd either like to see this tamed by a bourbon barrel, or just lose the lactose all together.","May 28, 2020"

This is full bodied with moderate carbonation and a sweet, almost syrupy mouthfeel. I really enjoy the aromas and flavors aside form the level of sweetness and syrupy mouthfeel; I’d those were a little dialed back I’d be much happier.

Double Shot,,Michigan,4.49/5,"Incredible stout. I initially rated it as an imperial stout - was fooled by its depth, complexity, flavors and richness - and then when submitting realized my error and had to change accordingly. Knowing that it was actually a stout made it incredibly impressive. 1/24/20 date printed on can. Pours a thick almost sludgy very dark brown, almost black color that was incredibly opaque. Lots of fluffy tan head and some spotty lingering lacing that settled into small soapy rings. Smells amazing, deep dark roast coffee, dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, bread, malt, roasted nuts, brown sugar, maybe a little stone fruit. Taste follows the nose, incredible depth and balance, again reminded me of an imperial stout. Definitely not like any regular stout I've had before.

A: Really hard not to mistake this for a BA beer. Pitch black, gorgeous mocha head. Decent amount of lacing up the glass. Literally almost pours out like motor oil, and I mean it.

S: Nice fresh coffee up front, little bit of cocoa and vanilla too. 

T: Way sweeter than I was expecting, but I'm okay with that. Coffee is not a huge player here, but mixes nice with heavy fudge, chocolate, coconut and molasses flavors. 

M: Here's where it's hit out of the park. This may be the best mouthfeel I've had on any stout, let alone beer. It is so unbelievably chewy and rich. The flavors just linger for days. Truly, truly special.

O: My introduction to dark beers by Tree House, and I am not disappointed. Holy smokes. The mouthfeel on this is world class. It's not a coffee-forward coffee beer, and that's okay. It just shows how complex it is with all the other flavors going on. BA tells me this is the #1 non-BA regular stout in the world. And while that's not a huge and coveted style, I don't see anything near it in this class. Beautifully done.

Recommendation: Yes.","Mar 03, 2020"

Clear seal brown liquid rests beneath a beige crust, receding to a thin ring and surface slick. Gentle lacing; slick thin sheen of tears.

Chocolate, fine tobacco, molasses, black licorice, cherry pits, black coffee, and brown sugar in the nose - stupendous.

Boozy, oaky, toasty, lightly charred, with perhaps even more flavor (following the nose) in the finish than on the palate. Wave after wave of malt and barrel complexity. Bittersweet and almost but never quite smokey/spicy. Mild bitterness throughout, earthy/woodsy medium-dry finish with hints of black tea and bourbon.

Slippery, almost oily mouth-feel, with some residual tannins.

Forgot how good the base beer can be, and the coffee adds another layer of roast/fruit/bitterness without distracting from the character of the stout. Wonderful example of the style.","Aug 20, 2023"

When I first tride OG Parabola I quite enjoyed it, but honestly had higher expectations. And I think coffee would improve upon the base beer, so I’m hopeful for this one. Let’s crack open this legendary variant of a legendary beer and see what it’s all about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of frothy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s definitely punchy in the nose, somewhere between roasty and bitter white still presenting a nice sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nib, earthy hops, roasted espresso, molasses, burnt toast, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and tobacco

It trends much more bitter in taste, but that underlying sweetness helps things from getting out of hand. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, earthy hops, cacao nib, dark roast coffee, plum, rye toast, burnt caramel, light vanilla, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of cacao nib, dark roast coffee, burnt toast, toasted oak, black cherry, caramel, earthy hops, light plum, and molasses

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes dry and roasty

Parabajava,,New York,4.25/5,"2022 version poured cellar temp to a mug. Base Parabola has always been excellent. This coffee version is good, with a new profile to the base. Gone is the bright, complex, woody bourbon up front. That has been replaced with a milder, more chocolate front. The middle is “Parabola” in body and flavor. The coffee comes into play as a mouthfeel factor and an end-sip lingering dirty cup of Joe. It’s a decent coffee flavor. It’s slightly odd to me that it comes into focus so late in the flavor. No alcohol burn, and really not much warming as one might expect from this big ABV bomb. For my money, I’d stick with base Parabola or the Anniversary offerings.","Mar 12, 2023"

The taste is absolutely insane. One of the best tastes from a coffee stout. Again, the coffee is front and center. A lovely fresh coffee taste. Not overly bitter at all. Dark chocolate, vanilla, marmalade, brown sugar, a touch of maple, walnuts, and salted caramel. The barrel comes through here for sure, but definitely complimentary rather than dominant.

T: Dark rich malts, on the sweeter side, big coffee here mixed in with chocolate. Not getting much cherry in this one as it’s very covered by the malty coffee chocolatiness. Getting some molasses, the dark cherry comes more in the after taste the more I sip and let it sit.

Parabajava,,Texas,4.53/5,"Extraordinarily rich and flavorful stout. Smell and taste of stewed, sweetened dark berries. Intense dark chocolate. Subtle licorice and dark coffee.

Parabajava,,California,4.69/5,"2019 vintage, 13.2% ABV, 56 IBU, purchased form the cooler at Firestone in September and refrigerated until now (about 5-6 weeks later) poured into 2 snifters from a 12 oz bottle. Off-black color, about 1/8 inch or less of head. virtually no lacing. Wonderful roasted grain and coffee smell, but not as intense as some others like this style. Taste follows the brewer's description quite well. Most excellent mouthfeel; very smooth and viscous. Overall one excellent beer marred only by the hefty pricetag of $10/12oz and I prefer a little more head retention and a little more coffee-forward smell, which I admit is totally subjective.","Oct 25, 2020"
Parabajava,,Georgia,4.6/5,"Look: very dark brown, nearly opaque. Some cola highlights when held to light. Nice frothy mocha head.

Notorious Triple IPA,,Washington,4.4/5,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.","May 05, 2022"
Notorious Triple IPA,,Oregon,4.46/5,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows. Tons of hops, tons of malt sweetness, boozy, and unabashedly so - you know it’s big but doesn’t drink like it’s 11.5%. A well done and tasty IIIPA. Recommended.","Jan 30, 2022"

Notorious Triple IPA,,Washington,4.22/5,"2020-10-02
32oz growler served in a SIP Fest 2020 snulip. Bought it yesterday at Thirsty Hop. I've had this several times before, but the first time in a situation where I could sit down and pay attention and write my thoughts.

Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Looks thick. Lots of fine slow carbonation. Smell is booze, pine, lemon. Might get a little honeysuckle.

Taste is a boozy blast, lemon and citrus for sure, so much resin and pine, kind of dancing around -- first I taste this, then that then it switches again. Hard bitter finish. Something kind of tropical in there, too.

Mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly dry. Overall...this is really good. Dangerously easy to drink. I knew it was really good. It's nice to pay attention to it. I consider this a prime example of west coast style TIPA.","Oct 02, 2020"

Smell: Big malt and hip aromatics with overripe pineapple and caramel driving the malt and and dank pithy pomelo on the hops

Taste: As with the aroma the malt and hops battle it out with the tropical fruit merging into dank tones; old school bitterness, through the middle with a boozy but dry finish

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; plenty of warmth in the gullet

Notorious Triple IPA,,Illinois,4.24/5,"10oz draft pour at the Three Floyds Taproom, poured into a snifter glass, enjoyed on 6.6.19, reviewed from tasting notes.

The beer pours a orange and amber color, golden hues when hit by the light and a firm finger of white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a few spots of soapy lacing. The aroma is very good, super resinous, lots of citrus peel, lightly floral, more on the dank side of things with a strong sticky sweet malt backbone, assertive and boozy. The flavors are great, bitter and resinous pine, dank floral and grassy qualities, lots of citrus peel that offers some tropical fruits but ultimately more bitterness and a heart malt backbone, strong caramel and amber malts with some softer cereal grains and a warm booze character. The mouthfeel is good, sticky, coating, medium bodied with a good liveliness to it and finishes with a big dry kick and a warm boozy bite.

Verdict: A very good west coast IPA from Boneyard. Classic in style, bold, brash, just a massive IPA, certainly boozy but with an oddly nice balance. West Coast through and through, just a massive IPA.","Jun 07, 2019"

JJJuiceee Machine,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Pouring that ubiquitous Tree House turbid, hazy color (in this case orange), the creamy off white head coats the glass as you drink the beer?

How do they do that EVERY SINGLE TIME? Anyway, the nose is a citrus juice lover’s delight, with slabs of mango, ripe oranges, and passion fruit assaulting your olfactory senses. Incredible.

The taste is simply the nose on PED’s, with the mango leading the citrus deployment for the ripe orange and passion fruit flavor, yet allowing a nice sweet oat flavor to cover the flank.

The mouthfeel is full, soft, and supple. It should be a felony to make an 8% ABV beer this drinkable, but it’s not surprising coming from the hazy masters.","Apr 14, 2023"

JJJuiceee Machine,,New Hampshire,4.28/5,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/11/22. Space juice. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing.

Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that.

Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple.

Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips.

Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing. Hey! what do you know, this is the 103rd Tree House beer I’ve reviewed. Point being: this one is virtually indistinguishable from probably 90% of the other TH NEIPA’s I’ve had.

Served in a tulip

Cloudy yellow ochre appearance. The turbid looking body was topped by a small, creamy, bright white crown that slowly transformed into a thin dollop of froth. Streaky, drippy lacing coated the glass and stuck around until the drink’s end.

The aroma was impressive. Really fruity and bold. Honeydew melon notes were most prominent. Peach and apricot also came through strong. Good dose of sticky mango too. Nice citrus presence as well. Juicy orange notes stuck out. After the head died down, the dry, chalky, proprietary Tree House yeast character appeared.

The flavor profile was very solid. Big honeydew melon presence up front. Loads of ripe peach too. Citrus notes took over mid palate. Nice melding of sweet, juicy orange and tangy tangerine. White grapefruit appeared on the back end. Pithy, bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes rounded things out in the finish.

Excellent smooth, creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence that turned frothy and slick on the palate.

Like the original Juice Machine, this beer was super fruity and bright up front but quite pithy and bitter on the finish. Although I really enjoyed it, there are many Tree House IPAs that are better.","Jun 17, 2022"

Pours a murky golden with a slight amber tinge, maybe a half inch of head that settles into a clumpy skin. Moderate active carbonation. Smell is moderate tropical juice and a ton of citrus pith.

Taste is a ton of juice, leaning heavily into tropical fruit, approaching overripe mango and pineapple territory. Balanced nicely by a citrus cut, lots of pithiness. Resin on the finish.

Brewers Notes: Once upon a time wrap, in a galaxy very, very, very far away there lived a ruthless race of being known as the JJJUICEEE MACHINE!

Utilizing the highly original blend of hops in Juice Machine at maximum volume, we built a singularly plush base beer to absorb and perfectly perpetuate this onslaught of hops.

It tastes of gooey mango, mandarin orange Hi-Chews, and sticky tropical fruit enveloped by a familiar and proprietary Tree House yeast character.

Highly unique and distinctive, the Triple J Juice Machine hits a chord we have not previously struck. Cherish and enjoy this wonderful concoction!

Hazy orange liquid , one finger dense white town cap , good retention , spotty lacings, settles to a thin layer and ring

JJJuiceee Machine,,Germany,4.46/5,"One month old. Can to pint glass.

Look: Pours a full and hazy yellow with a medium thick foam leaving a good bit of lacing.

Smell: Subtle notes of pineapple and tangerine. 

Taste: Tropical mango and pineapple paired with sweet orange citrus fruits. Sweet body with a slightly zesty and bitter finish.

Feel: Full and juicy with a low carbonation. A bit sticky.

Overall: Great brew which does its name justice being very juicy and fruity. Even though it's a bit heavy on the tropical and sweet side, I prefer this one over the base version as it's less sharp and more balanced. However, it would be even better with a higher level of carbonation.","Feb 02, 2022"

Absolutely intense fruity aroma, noticeable from feet away. Notes of mango, melon, tangerine, papaya, mandarin orange, and a touch of pineapple.

Similar presentation on the palate, along with a bit of a green herbal note as well as grapefruit peel. Lush and juicy. Mouthfeel is sublime, a near perfect blend of pillowy softness, creamy fullness, and just enough lively bite.

L -- Surprisingly deep amber-orange body with very high opacity and two fingers of white head produced with moderate pour. Good retention and great lacing, although this looks less carbonated than most TH offerings
S -- Pithy citrus, fresh pine sap, dank weedy resins, mango, touch of banana. Much more in-your-face than OG Juice Machine, which had a real fruit smoothie thing going on
T -- Mango, yellow grapefruit pith, fruity yeast esters, and a surprising amount of generic hop bitterness
F -- Medium+ mouthfeel, medium carb. Usual TH fluffiness 
O -- I actually started liking this less the more I drank of it. I really like Juice Machine because of how creamy and smoothie-like it is; this is just much more hop-forward and aggressive.

The nose is of dark roast coffee, roasted malt and a touch of mapley sweetness. I can’t wait to dive in.

The feel is thick and chewy, and the taste follows the nose; robust coffee notes with a touch of sweet maple. Fantastic stout with huge flavor. And loving that it’s only 7.7%. (The fact that I used the word “only” goes to show how out of control ABVs have gotten!)

One drawback as I get deeper into the glass is that the bitter burnt coffee notes that I found pleasant at the beginning turn into a laborious astringency that makes me take the taste points down a notch.","Aug 05, 2022"

Moment Of Clarity,,Massachusetts,3.51/5,"16oz can poured into a snifter.

A: Dark brown, nearly black. Huge brown head is comprised of large bubbles and sticks around for a while. It’s rather cola-like in appearance, but for the head’s staying power.

S: Cola, fudge sauce, dark maple syrup, faint coffee acidity, woody and nutty, mild roast. Pretty straightforward and surprisingly subdued. 

T: Plenty of dark maple syrup up front. Sweet cola, blackstrap molasses, mild roast. Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Nutty coffee struggles to pull through, but eventually succeeds for only a fleeting second. Tight stewed prune dark fruit notes. Decidedly sweet throughout. There’s some slight acidity and roast, but not enough to fully balance. Maple syrup all over the long and sweet finish.

M: There’s a bit of a creamy and fluffy texture here, but ultimately the residual sweetness dominates with a syrupy and coating feel. It’s downright sticky. Carbonation is ample but soft. 

O: Pretty much all of Tree House’s stouts and porters trend well into the sweet side of the spectrum. Some find a way to strike a balance and keep the sweetness in check just enough, and some end up fairly cloying. This one is unfortunately in the latter camp. It’s just too sweet and sticky. Play up the smokey/roasty/coffee flavors more and they might have a more drinkable end product here. As it stands this was a tough 16oz to finish.","Aug 19, 2020"

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that quickly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here is huge and sweet, tons of maple, maybe more than I’ve detected in a beer ever. The coffee is rich and roasty and the chocolate is incredibly sweet. Undertones of vanilla and caramel round things out

On the front end, I get a decent amount of drip coffee and smooth maple syrup. Things bitter up mid palate but nothing too crazy, just a touch more roast. The aftertaste is long and brings bittersweet dark chocolate and even more maple syrup

A full body with very mild carbonation leads to a smooth drinking experience. Finishes sticky but it works out here

Taste- Rich roasted bready malt, sweet chocolate and maple syrup, coffee, burnt sugar/caramel and vanilla. Light coffee like bitterness that doesn't linger on the finish.

Canned: Aug-2-2023

That's what I'm talking about! After a couple TH beers that seemed noticeably different in overall profile than my memory of them, I was starting to get worried that either they had majorly tweaked something, my memory was failing, my senses were wonky, or (worst of all) that I had fallen prey to reverse lupulin threshold shift. But praise be! That doesn't seem to be the case. This bad boy is dead on. 

From the look to the aroma to the taste to the palate, the whole thing just pops and met my standard (unconscious audible groan/swearing) for being nigh-perfect. Solid representation of the style, to my tastes and noticeably a Tree House character. Can't do much better than that. 

The nose and flavor are big characterful mixes of sweet citrus, ripe mango with a dash of boozy citrus/lupuline oil aromatics. Like the oil that you can see spray off a twisted rind of the light is just right. The flavor is similar and has a nice bitter but not overly bitter, boozy but not too much finish to it that kind of dissolves into orange rind and makes it take all my concentration to not just plow through the glass. As it warms (and this one started out at cellar temp*) the perfumey/boozy character mentioned above melts into a creamy, sweet sort of character that really ties the whole beer together and sums up that classic estery, fruity, soft, juicy TH character. Simply excellent. 

Glad I have a couple more and many thanks, Minor God of Drunken Flannel, for peer pressuring me into buying it.

I think there well could be something to that and my last 3-4 seeming a little lackluster. Lesson to you kids out there that warmer is often better contrary to what Big Beer™ brainwashes us with.

Emperor Julius,,Massachusetts,3.93/5,"Pours a turbid golden with off white head, great retention to be fair. Freshly squeezed Florida oranges straight off the tree. I find that Tree House beers don't always deliver on the hoppy aromatics but this one does somewhat. I get a lot of mango kind of in that Dole Tropical juice deliver, with some rind citrus on the finish. On subsequent sips, the rind and citrus which you could call dank is more pronounced and the tropicality has all but disappeared. It's sharp as @sabtos said. It's kind of boring after the first sip to be honest. And it lacks the balance that regular Julius has. This is fine.","Jun 29, 2023"

Emperor Julius,,Massachusetts,4.15/5,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Tewksbury, MA
3/15/23
Served in a tulip

Medium bodied and somewhat darker, dullish orange in appearance. The liquid was topped by a small, creamy white head that quickly broke into a bubbly, lasting halo. Drippy, streaky lacing cascaded down the sides of the glass.

The aroma was solid. There was a strong generic topical fruit presence initially, but it was soon overtaken by potent citrus notes. Bit of rind-like pith too. The alcohol was definitely punchier than I anticipated. Booze spiked oranges came to mind. Dry, powdery yeasty notes were initially detectable, but they soon dissipated. Some bubblegum was also noticeable. Ripe mango was apparent too, and it intensified as the beer warmed.

The flavor profile was super citrus forward from start to finish. Orange notes came through strong up front. Juicy orange flesh soon transformed into pithy, bitter orange rind as the beer moved along the palate. Grapefruit notes took over in the center. Quite dry and bitter. More lingering, pithy citrus rind on the back end and the finish. Some dry, yeasty notes were apparent on the second pour.

Nice fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Creamy, slick and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence.

Emperor Julius is an enjoyable beer for sure, though it did not blow me away as I had hoped. Tree House may have become famous for their Julius series IPAs, but compared to other hoppy offerings, they now seem to lack complexity and nuance.","Apr 19, 2023"
Emperor Julius,,Connecticut,4.61/5,"Very good head production, retention, and lacing. Beautiful beer for the style.

Aroma is wonderful and potent, with a nicely present bitterness, and hop notes of mango, pineapple, guava, tangerine, basil, cream, and lemon zest.

Just as balanced and potent on the palate, with similar tasting notes. It has that classic orange creamsicle note of OG Julius, along with a heavier, creamier malt base, and more of an alcohol note (really, any alcohol note is ""more"" than Julius). You can definitely tell, in this case, that you're drinking a big beer.

Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, but there's much more sting than I expected. One the one hand, that makes it a bit livelier and more refreshing; on the other, it's less pillowy and creamy than what you might expect from Tree House.

This is an absolute home run. Tree House variations (improvements, some might say) on their core beers (Julius, Haze, Green, et al) aren't always better than the originals, in my opinion. This is one that arguably improves on the original in almost every way.","Apr 10, 2023"

Emperor Julius,,Massachusetts,3.64/5,"16oz can poured into a globe. 12/18 canning date, a little over a month old at time of consumption.

A: Tawny colored with a very opaque swamp water haze. Fine-bubbled, fluffy head is cream-colored. Retention is decent, but the head does settle after a bit. Collars of lacing as the liquid disappears. 

S: Juicy overripe mango, skin and all. Clementine. Ruby red grapefruit with sugar dumped all over. Star fruit and pineapple juice. It's got that tropical Juicy Juice thing going on. Just a little bit of a super green grassy note. Dough and confectioners sugar. Hint of toast.

T: Surprisingly earthy up front with a leafy and oily flavor. Apricot, clementine, and overripe mango pull through. Grapefruit, in a big way. Big pull of spicy alcohol. Toasty grain. Doughy. Feels muddled, gritty, and dull. Finish is a lot more hoppy earthiness and lingering alcohol. 

M: Full and hefty in body. Round and firm in texture with some silkiness. Ample carbonation cuts through sharply. Lots of gritty hop astringency and a little bit of hop burn. Alcohol isn't quite what I'd call hot, but it's a couple notches short.

O: Woof, I think this one got away from them a little bit. It feels a bit over-hopped with the grittiness and burn going on, and it approaches boozy too. Playful tropical notes take a back seat to a lot of leafy earthiness. Overall it feels muddled and messy. Aroma is solid enough, but taste suffers quite a bit. Not sure if the hopping crossed over into ""way too much of a good thing"" territory or what. I really don't want to finish this can, though.","Jan 29, 2023"
Emperor Julius,,Illinois,4.75/5,"Can, purchased at Tree House and consumed within 2 weeks. Juicer version of King Julius. Simple as that.

Emperor Julius,,Pennsylvania,4.71/5,"Poured from a 16oz can into pint glass in October 2022. There was a canned date of 05/19/22 on the bottom of the can. I bought this at the brewery, and drank this about 3 months after purchase.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.8% listed on the can.

This is an excellent New England IPA. As expected, similar to King Julius, but with a little more citrus flavors. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it enjoyable. I like the overall balance, and would definitely buy this again. This is another great beer from Tree House, and one of my favorite IPAs, along with IPAs from Tired Hands and Adroit Theory.","Oct 20, 2022"
Emperor Julius,,North Carolina,4.5/5,"Appearance: With a bubble show, the head creams out at three fingers atop the apricot nectar liquid; excellent retention and webby lacing

Smell: Clementine orange, peach, apricot and mango; a touch of honey

Taste: Mango and peach forward with apricot and a hint of honey adding depth; through the middle, the Clementine orange starts to dominate; moderate bitterness with a bit of bite in the aftertaste

Mouthfeel: Medium to full body and creamy; moderate carbonation

Overall: King Julius was a bit brighter, to my palate, but this is quite good; of the various Tree House IPAs I have tasted, I think the Julius line is my favorite

Emperor Julius,,New Jersey,4.46/5,"Ever think you've had too many IPA's and then you find one that makes you realize that you haven't tried everything worth having?

Yeah, this was one of those beers.

One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.

I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!","Sep 08, 2022"

Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Connecticut,4.32/5,"Very good head production, but retention is lacking, fading to only the thinnest possible ring around the rim of the glass before long. Body is a lovely obsidian hue, cola-like along the edges.

Aroma is quite strong, prominently featuring the bourbon. Notes of bourbon mash, brown sugar, oak, leather, red grape, cherry, coconut, syrup.

Flavor absolutely delivers on a classic, BCBS-like BBA imperial stout. Lots of bourbon, but not overpowering; moderate char; bitter, but not overly hoppy nor too roasty, coming across on the more restrained side of RIS. Toffee, ginger cookies, raisin, coffee, prune, bourbon, oak, leather, white pepper, blackstrap molasses.

Exceptionally easy to sip, savor, and chew, despite the ABV and barrel influence. Does finish fairly hot on the back third, letting you know just how big it is.

This is an excellent BA RIS, with tons of complexity and an admirable restraint on all fronts. It's supremely drinkable, and less rich than most others, without sacrificing flavor. That said, I personally wish it delivered more richness along with that complexity, perhaps just a touch more sweetness and thickness.

Undated can. Served at 53.4 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 57.7 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque except at the edges – bottom edge ruby, top edge olive. 
Head – Average (Maximum 1.2 cm, aggressive center pour), buff, high density with a few surface rocks, quickly diminishing to a 0.1 – 0.15 cm crown and a thin island.
Lacing – None. Not much expected at 11% ABV.
Aroma – 4.25 – Chocolate, weak char, and some hints of bourbon. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Chocolate and slight char with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Bourbon not detected. Slight oakiness. No hops or yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. Moderate gastric warming occurs. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. 
Palate – 4 – Medium, dry side of creamy, soft but lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 (After deducting 0.25 point for undated personal container) Look unremarkable, pretty much like every other high ABV RIS or Impy stout. Aroma is fairly typical but has a char note that many lack and lacks the coffee notes that many have. Bourbon is present on the nose but seems absent in the taste. The taste also has both chocolate and char as well as an oakiness from vanillin but lacks the tannin notes. As the temperature reaches the end, some bourbon notes finally appear. Overall, a good RIS that’s certainly more subtle than most.","Dec 05, 2022"

12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. No date that I can see. Received in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #14 from @Whyteboar.

Pours black, opaque, thick-looking but not syrupy, with a fairly small but fairly persistent head. Smell is extremely rich, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dates, tons of anise.

Taste is super chocolatey, lots of vanilla, anise is more on the back end, hoppy/roasty bitterness coming a bit after that. Building up, giving me burnt toffee character.

Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Ohio,3.81/5,"12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth. 

This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it.","Mar 02, 2021"

12 oz wax-tipped bottle, into a snifter. 

Crude-oil brew, viscous as hell. No apparent carbonation, no head. Nose is anise-forward, with notes of molasses and oak at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are full of licorice and root beer. Molasses, tobacco, hints of coffee and leather. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected given the lack of carbonation. Medium finish (for the style), sweet with lingering residuals.

Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,,Washington,4.56/5,"12oz can courtesy of Dimidiata. Been sitting on it for a bit, and decided it would be an excellent Valentine for myself.

Poured into a snifter, it was the color of the mood of Philadelphia Eagles fans right now. Virtually no head besides a very thin line of tan bubbles around the rim. Not a great looking beer, but it's not surprising considering how strong it is.

As expected, it smells like a big Stout brewed with the adjunct ingredients of vanilla and bourbon barrels, with an unexpected touch of what smells like Graham crackers. Smells like a luscious dessert.

Tastes like it smells, but better. It's not a subtle beer, but you don't drink beers like this for subtlety. The bourbon Barrel flavor is fairly mellow and refined, and the vanilla is at a level that melts well with that, unlike a lot of beers I've had with vanilla added to it. That Graham crackery thing I noticed in the nose is present in the taste as well. I do not believe any graham crackers were abused in the making of this beer, perhaps it's a byproduct of the vanilla and bourbon mixing. It is utterly delicious, that's for sure.

Fairly creamy mouth feel, body is somewhere between medium and full.

This is a glorious dessert beer. Perhaps also my last from Modern Times. But, hey, they're going out on a high note with me. Thanks, Christine!","Feb 14, 2023"

It's got that cake-like sweetness with a touch of dried cherry, just super authentic and not at all artificial. The base stout is super chocolatey, with some roast and a touch of coffee like bitterness, with some caramel and oak on top of it from the barrel.

Modem Tones – Bourbon Barrel Aged & Vanilla is true to its name. Vanilla heavy, this is like being wrapped in vanilla orchids & partially drowned in 100% vanilla stuff. Mid-palate, cleared by the vanilla fist, is a sharp sting of bourbon with a subtle undercurrent of cocoa nibs. Stand-a-spoon-up-in-it thick. But drinkable. Oh, so, drinkable.

T: Nice balance between rich powdery dark chocolate, vanilla bean, and bourbon, along with a bit of alcohol. Finishes with a moderate sweetness that places this firmly in the dessert category.

It leaves room at the intermission for chocolate fudge, a bit of vanilla ice cream flavour, milk chocolate and a slight bit of roast, but ultimately returns at the end as if to tell everyone else that their time is up, and finishes with a moderate heat that is balanced a bit by the vanilla ice cream sweetness.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,New Jersey,4.6/5,"2022 Version

Pours out a very dark brown. On a straight pour, very little foam is agitated out. 

Nose is oak, roasted malt, and a peppery quality. Almost like rye spice. If I didn't know any better, I'd say that this was a rye barrel aged stout. Or perhaps even a rye based stout. 

On the taste, however, there is more of a story. Oak and bourbon come through first on the palate. Behind that is the roasted malt bringing a dark bread note and a beautiful dark chocolate the sings throughout. I picture an overdone rugelach with a dark chocolate filling in my minds eye with this brew. The only sweetness being from what little is in the dough and the mildly sweetened chocolate. While the oak shows up quickly, it dims down as the palate progresses, and the more subtle flavors appear. Like a tide retreating to show the rocks that sit beneath. 

Mouthfeel is fullbodied but not oily or cloying. It has heft, but not the residue that often accompanies. There is drying for sure, most likely due to ABV and barrel tannins. The carbonation is considerable too, for a stout at this percentage. Mild compared to most anything else, but surprising in this regard.

Overall this is what I expected from Alesmith. A respectful, expert brew. The base brew is a hallmark; an example of how often ""less is more"". The barrel aging brings it up a notch while still maintaining that level of composure and elegance. I had no doubt that this would be a world-class offering.","Sep 11, 2023"

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Virginia,4.46/5,"The beer pours a nice brown head that dissipates fairly quickly while the beer itself is a dark chocolate black with a nice glossy sheen to it.

The smell is absolutely delicious. The bourbon and coffee come out first and followed by a nice mild and soft vanilla alongside a bittersweet dark chocolate. There is a noticeable alcohol note that shines through but doesn't really hurt it that much.

The taste is phenomenal! It has the same notes as the smell with a few additions. The oak note is more present in the taste and lasts through the whole thing. The bitter coffee note comes out first and the bourbon doesn't show up until towards the finish alongside the chocolate. There is also no alcohol notes.

The feel is good. It has a very smooth body with a tingling feeling from the carbonation. It also packs quite a bit of heat for a barrel aged beer.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Minnesota,4.7/5,"12oz - 2022 version. Glugs out black with a rim of mocha head. Smell is the chocolate, coffee and bourbon, in that order, then the order reverses as it warms. The taste is lots of tasty bourbon barrel heat, coffee bitterness, and sweet milk chocolate. As it warms it takes on a french toast / maple scent and taste, some subtle dark fruit... But no any rasins or dry leaves. Surprisingly well carbonated, suitable for aging...

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Illinois,4.49/5,"Roasty, boozy, malty. Warming up helps it round out into a pretty good beer. When it’s cold, it’s a bit thin and the flavors don’t come through.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Minnesota,4.36/5,"12oz bottle. Label identifies this as '2022' product.
Black colored body, with an extremely thin dark mahogany back lit edge. 1-1/2 mocha brown head, which settles back to an interrupted cap with an active surface. Leaves a couple of thin strings of lacing.
Aroma of roasted barley malt, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Has vanilla and sweet bourbon.
Taste has bourbon drenching all the flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark coffee. Has some expression of dark cherry. Chocolate first and then coffee. The bourbon, with its vanilla, cover everything and extend far into the aftertaste.
Seems like a thin mouth feel at first, but thickens as the body is held in the mouth. Slight coating after each sip. Noticeable alcohol burn on the tongue. Supportive carbonation.
This is a great sipping brew, similar to a slow sipping whiskey. Savor each sip to get the full expression.","Jul 30, 2022"

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,California,4.37/5,"Bought from bottle craft in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. $8.5 for a 12 oz bottle

A&S: Appearance looks pretty bland. No real head or lacing. The speaks of the head that are there, are brown. The aroma is pretty amazing. Powerful bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, toasted malts, and some coffee.

T&M: Taste is pretty tasty. Slightly bitter, sweet syrup, caramel tones in the finish. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to the taste in my opinion. I have been getting this with stouts for a while now, and I definitely, get it with this beer, but soy sauce is a part of the taste. Fantastic feel. Super rich texture, almost creamy. Carbonation adds a tiny kick, but not enough to take away from the milky tones.

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,California,4.28/5,"So this is a George Burns beer - we are talking 100 here and stuff. Now, to be honest, I don’t know much about old George; but the fact that he made it to the ripe old age of 100 is pretty dandy in my book. Meanwhile, a beer that’s rated 100 on BA is pretty wild too. Coming full circle, I’m feeling it. Barrel Aged Speedway might not be as cool as some old dude who smoked cigars a good deal of his life and lasted so long, but it’s like the cool dude at your local Elks Lodge who smashes at Shuffleboard and randomly buys you a beer because he’s cool like that.

Curiosity Thirty Two,,Connecticut,4.33/5,"Canned on 7/5/23; consumed on 8/12/23

Pours an opaque, sunflower-orange hue capped with two fingers of creamy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a finger of frothy cap and dense collar, while a generous spattering of spotty lacing coats the walls of the glass.

Aromas of ripe mango are accented with guava zest and pineapple husk, with orange oils informing a peppery dank as a creamy, floral build settles through the bouquet.

Taste brings mango bubblegum into notes of orange and mango as white pepper stimulates an earthier aspect of peach zest over the mid-palate and Orange Tang invigorates the close.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and a moderate spritz of carbonation, levying a subdued bog to a drying prickle past the mid-palate toward a back end both subliminally resinous and coyly juicy.

An initially tropical amalgam explores myriad hop subtext in a turn toward swampy, earthy rinds before reinvigorating a brighter, cleaner base; a sampling of the Tree House IPA profile at its most comprehensive form.","Aug 13, 2023"

L: 2F soapy head, minimal retention, very little lacing, a bit of a cap and ring. Beer is a hazy golden orange.

S: Lots of citrus in the nose, including oranges, lemon peel, and grapefruit, and some tropical fruit like pineapple. Very light malt presence. At three weeks, the nose is more soft and rounded rather than bombed in your face. It's very nice.

T: Lots of juicy citrus up-front, slightly unsweetened. You get orange variants, lemon and lime peel, mango, pineapple, and then grapefruit comes in on the back end along with a little bit of malt. Stays on the very slightly bitter side of the spectrum, but only slightly.

F: Medium bodied, medium carbonation. You get some good drying on the finish that helps keep the bitterness well under control. Great construction, as always, and great balance.

Curiosity Thirty Two,,Massachusetts,4.95/5,"Acquired in a trade. Canned 3/3/17 (looked up, I got one of those cans that the date machine jumbled), reviewed 3/12/17.
Poured into a Tree House tulip glass.

A: The beer is a slightly bright orange. Close to orange juice in color. On the BJCP color chart, this probably comes in at a ""Yellow - 4"". Medium vigor pour produced about a finger of white, fluffy head that dissipated in a few minutes.

S: The nose on this beer is amazing. You get the oranges and mango from the citra while the white grape juice/vinous character of the nelson hops blends subtly, making this smell that much juicier. Malts, provide little, if any, presence on the nose.

T: Taste follows the nose, an explosion of orange and mango, maybe some peach. The vinous character comes through a little more than in the nose but is a great blend of flavors, making it a little more complex. As expected, only a little hint of malt presence and no trace of alcohol anywhere. The yeast profile is very similar to other Tree House offerings, so I'm guessing it's the same yeast. A little bubblegum character.

F: The mouth feel is soft and smooth. Body is medium, medium plus. Carbonation is as low as most other Tree House offerings, letting the flavor linger for quite a while. A little bit of bitterness on the finish that reminds you that this is still beer.

O: I love love love this beer. It's a simple, yet awesome balance of two pronounced hops with a simple malt bill. I would drink this over any of their regular offerings every day of the week. This is probably my #3 Tree House beer behind King Jjjuliusss and Doubleganger.","Mar 13, 2017"

Curiosity Thirty Two,,Massachusetts,4.58/5,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Monson, MA

Served in a Tree House teku
Huge thanks to my friend Sean for trading me this can.

Really dig the artwork. The label reminds me of a scene from Western Massachusetts in the Fall. As for the beer, it poured a cloudy yellow ochre and was topped by a frothy, bright white, inch-tall crown. Decent retention. The head slowly dropped to a lasting collar. Big patches of soapy lacing stuck along the glass.

The aroma was really hoppy and intense. Super fruity and exotic. Stewed peach and apricot notes dominated initially. Loads of mango and papaya. There was an intensely dank and weedy quality too. Subtle grape must notes appeared as the beer warmed. This must have been the Nelson hops rearing their head. 

The flavor profile was also amazingly hoppy and fruity forward. Big, juicy orange and tangerine notes appeared up front. Somewhat tart and tangy. Peach and mango came through in the center. Crisp lemon notes too. More orange and orange rind on the back end and the finish. Just the slightest hint of bitterness.

Terrific mouthfeel. The liquid contained a super fine, frothy, plush effervescence. Medium bodied for the style. Creamy, slick and smooth on the palate.

Tree House's hoppy beers never fail to impress me, and this Nelson and Citra dry hopped Curiosity series variation is one of their better to date. While strange that neither hop varietal seemed overtly prominent, the beer was still remarkably fruity and delicious.","Mar 10, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,New York,4.75/5,"Canned 3/3/17. Reviewed 3/9/17.

A: A bit brighter than some of the other Curiosities of late, this one comes in a light gold / straw yellow mashup with a thinner head than I've come to expect from Tree House beers. But god damn, if that can art isn't one of the best I've seen from them.. 4.75 just for that alone!!

S: Vinous/earthy white grape stands out most prominently. Tons of melon (think: cantaloupe), mango, and a rich doughy malt backbone that almost throws off some vanilla cream aromas for me. Smells decadent and rich and supremely complex.

T: Follows with bright melon and mango up front, which nicely transitions to a creamy, dry, moderately bitter grapefruit juice finish. Dusty white grape and a wonderfully creamy malt base are in the background throughout. Getting that same sweet doughy (almost vanilla-esque) malt presence esp heavily on the finish, which features a wonderful fusion of Nelson dryness and light citrus from the Citra. Wow.

M: Archetypically Tree House on the feel... Hefty yet light, C-32 attacks the palate with flavor (and abnormally substantial doses of sweetness and bitterness) while retaining an effervescence and spritziness that offers incredible drinkability. Seems to borrow from the IPAs of old (well, maybe of 5 years ago) with that pithy grapefruit bite, but not, of course, without a creamy sweetness to balance it out. In contrast to the last few Curiosities, this one is intense, drinking with a degree of flavor that suggests high-ABV DIPA without a trace of alcohol.

O: Another fine entry into the Curiosity series. With each iteration, I increasingly appreciate the experimentation involved in crafting these beers. The Citra + Nelson combination in this creates a beer that is different from any other Tree House beer I've had while remaining distinctly Tree House. Right up there with 27 and 28 as one of my favorites in the series.","Mar 09, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,Massachusetts,4.88/5,"Wow, where to begin with the one, sick can label for starters....pours a yellow, wheat color, and has the standard murkiness of a TH pale ale. The smell is tropical fruit, citrus, particularly grapefruit, and I get a bready aroma lingering in the back. Taste is smooth smooth smooth, tangerine and grapefruit, touch of tropical fruits, balanced with a malty, biscuit, and just a slight hint of dank. Light rounded bitterness feels perfect here. The fruit is much less in your face than many of the other TH Ipa's I've had. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, terrific, slight bitterness as mentioned. Overall this a just a great beer. All the flavors and aspects just fit together perfectly like a complex puzzle. While it is not an absolute juice bomb like many of their IPAs(not that I don't love the bombs) I feel this is one of the most well balanced Treehouse offerings in the IPA/APA category. It is just a smooth, delicious, well balanced and thought out beer that goes down so so easily, especially considering its 8% abv....really hoping this comes back when they make the move, this recipe is a real banger","Mar 07, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,Massachusetts,4.9/5,"I had no idea what to expect with this one. Had it out of a growler the first day it was bottled. Looks just like orange juice, smells like oranges, lemons and clementines. Full mouth feel, simply outstanding. Of Tree House's bests.","Mar 05, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,Connecticut,4.56/5,"What if Haze and Green had a baby pale ale? C32 is basically that.

Looks like any TH beer. Orange cloudy murky color aka unfiltered. The smell to me is Haze and Green combined. There is that twang of Haze and the pine of Green. Just an awesome smell. Taste H+G. Has the Haze upfront and Green on the back end. I will say C32directly out of the fridge and super cold mutes a ton of flavor needs at least 30 minutes out of the fridge otherwise this beer is just a 4ish beer for me. The feel is more of a pale ale for me but tons of mouth coating flavor.

Overall, is this a must trade for? I would say yes but it's borderline. The taste is different from what TH normally offers and is 100% a delicious IPA to be shared with.","Mar 05, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,Connecticut,4.64/5,"Purchased at brewery tonight. 

Pours hazy orange with light head and execellent lacing

Aroma is citrus up front , sweetness and biscuit late and Nelson wine aroma also on the back end. 

Never had Nelson/citra combo and I have to say I really enjoy it. Nelson tends to overpower most other hops but combined with citra the combination works very well. 

Mouthfeel is super creamy with great lingering back end bitterness . 

Overall- another great treehouse IPA. This and c27 are my 2 favs in the curiousity series. If u are a fan of either citra or Nelson u must try this. Great job once again. Props on the artwork too. Really cool can","Mar 03, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,Connecticut,4.76/5,"L - we were bamboozled with the can art! Posting it all over Twitter days beforehand... it was right under our noses the entire time! That said, it is a nice can art. Simple, solid block colors. Can't go wrong with silhouettes. Oh yes, the beer. Glowing yellow is right. Pours a neon wheaty yellow and settles into a gradient composed of yellow and yellow. So in less wordy words: solid yellow. Well, dark yellow. Hardly lets light in even from the top of the glass when held to my fluorescent bulb. 

S - initial aromas are of light, buoyant fruits. Clementines, satsuma, soft lemon. Permeating melon dominates with a hidden crackery malt in the very end to tie it all together. Slightly darkens with what I presume is the Nelson. Robust white grape heavy graininess without too much actual grape smell. 

T - taste is a burst of bright and dark. Huge melon explodes up front, but is quickly tamed by a meatier vinous meal that settles somewhere in the middle with bittersweet ruby red grapefruit rind. The taste is as robust as it smells and everything about this beer is packed full of hearty flavor. Like biting into a juicy, ripe, sweaty mango. Mature. 

F - this one is rich and full of, well, fullness. Incredibly chewy and saturated. Almost dessert-like. 

O - it seems Tree House is particularly proud of C32, and rightfully so. Ardent and uncompromisingly brimming with juice and hops, this hits all the right notes for a soft, creamy vacation amongst the clouds.","Mar 03, 2017"
Curiosity Thirty Two,,Connecticut,4.74/5,"This Curiosity reminds me of pulling into parking lot one and getting a whiff of the brewery. It is typical for a TH IPA... that is to say the color mouthfeel and wonderful smell are all present. Looks like orange juice and drinks like it too. There is a lot of energy in the first swig. It feels light and energetic. As we go further I can taste a slight pleasant hint of malt that ends with a touch of rewarding bitter (the orange pulp).

Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,,Kentucky,4.31/5,"Never wavering and as juicy, succulent and balanced as ever for the beer's at the Cutting Tiles head of the class, the careful use of raw wildflower honey gives the exotic and curious hops of Mosaic more of a ripe fruit quality than they can munster on their own. Breaming with vibrancy, the hop-centric beer retains a semi-sweet balance for both complexity and smoothness.

The Mosaic version of Cutting Tiles pours with a heavy haze, golden matte finish, capped with a rich and creamy meringue. A strong herbal perfum is followed with tropical fruit, berry and botanicals which tease the nose while the taste is lightly pastry-like with honey, caramel and an overall angel-food malt profile.

With the sweetness holding serve through the middle palate, its the fruity hop blend grows into bitterness seamlessly. Blood orange, grapefruit, mango, nectarine, apricot and cantaloup each align on the tongue with the dripping sweet and slightly acidic action of citrus fruit with other influences of blackcurrant, mint and black tea. Spruce, chive and dank herb frame a finish that circulates around the peppery bitterness of black tea, verbena, sassafras and cannabis.

Nearly teeth churning and mouth-watering at the same time, the medium-full IPA carries a peppery dryness deep into aftertaste with the balancing bitter bite accompanying the spruce. But lingering sweetness keeps the fruit impressions bold and bright, crisp and clean, refreshing and tropical punch-like all at once.","Mar 09, 2023"

Nose is very nice, very dank with citrus and stone fruit theme going.

Taste is a light but significant pale malt base that gives the hops to showcase a peach forward flavor profile with a touch of orange lingering in the back. Finishes pale ale like balance; 5/10 on my bitterness scale.

Pours a light but opaque orange. On the nose I'm getting the honey and citrus, and can definitely smell the strength. Taste really follows the nose except the citrus comes first, followed by a very interesting aftertaste of malt followed by honey. Mouthfeel is great but I feel like the carbonization is a bit sharp.

Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,,New Jersey,4.65/5,"Pours a rather hazy yellow with a finger of soapy white head. This looks great. Dense haze, nice foam, and solid retention. 

Nose is tropical notes, pineapple and mango, peach, and grassy/piney hops. A touch of candy like quality. Sweetness. This smells great as well.

Taste follows the nose. Tropical notes. Pineapple and mango. The sweet peach is here too. Juicy fruit flavors. Grass and pine are stronger. There is also this savory quality that lingers in the aftertaste. Like onion initially. But on the finish it merges with the malt backbone. Such a distinct savory finish. Really well balanced. Medium bitterness and mild hop burn, but never gets too overwhelming.

Mouthfeel is smooth. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. An almost silky quality. Light and very drinkable.

Overall a fantastic IPA. My introduction to Trillium and a spectacular one indeed.","Sep 14, 2020"
Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,,Maryland,4.9/5,"Appearance:
Pours a thick, pulpy, pollen yellow. Offers up a docile, white foam that exhibits persistent, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mid-summer’s breeze of juicy peach slices, ripe pineapple, and a big, bold burst of citrusy, white grapes

Feel:
A medium body that’s soft and cushy as a goose feather pillow. Silky carbonation.

Taste:
What’s this? A double IPA that’s floral and fruity and sweet? That doesn’t sear the hair from your nostrils and singe the edges of your tongue with a brutal, hallucination-inducing, 9 million IBU? And it’s brewed with something BESIDES JUST HOPS? 

Instead of an eye-watering, oral enema of barbaric hops, Cutting Tiles presents a deeply delicate palate of candied peaches, tender nectarines, and a dry, strawberry liquor finish. All wrapped up in a woolly blanket of raw, wildflower honey. A meteoric wad of hops, with a screaming comet’s tail of booze heat, crash lands with an earth-shaking BOOM at the very end; but the lead up to this crescendo is so sensual and sweet that the normally abrasive blast of hops comes across as palate-arousing piquancy.","May 06, 2020"

Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,,Tennessee,4.54/5,"Absolutely phenomenal beer, and my favorite Trillium IPA (or APA, or IIPA) to date.

Had on tap with lunch at the beautiful new (ish) Fort Point location. Beautiful, hazy, golden-orange body of pure juice, soft soft, off-white lacing (almost no head with a to-the-brim pour).

Aromas and flavors are absolutely stunning with massive citrus, mango, pineapple, and white grape. Fairly grassy but massively juicy with absolutely no astringency or hop burn. The honey sends it over the top for me, as I like a little extra sweetness in my big IPAs. But there's some honest, resiny, pithy bitterness in the background that keeps things semi-grounded and lingers quite nicely along with the fruit juice sweetness. So many bold notes at play here, and they come together amazingly. Dangerously poundable for an 8.5% beer.

Feel is actually a touch thin for a IIPA of this size, but still very smooth and silky.

Absolute winner.","Sep 16, 2019"
Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,,Massachusetts,4.58/5,"Extremely well-done. Lots and lots of lupulin.

Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,,California,4.6/5,"Cutting Tiles (mosaic) pours a hazy, golden honey color with a well formed, tight knit, one finger head that sticks around. The smell is backed by a big floral note and juicy citrus fruits with a scant sweetness. The taste has an excellent mouthfeel, soft and smooth over the palette with citrus and tropical fruits shinning through. There is a rich sweetness from the wild flower, raw honey and just enough hop bitterness to balance this double out.","Jul 04, 2019"

S: Notes of huge tropical fruit with mango, pineapple, guava and some honey sweetness. 

T: Fruity hops pound you with loads of tropical fruit. Pineapple, mango, guava, some slight citrus and a little bit if earthy herbal flavors. Sweetness comes from the honey as the finish turns fruity and dry. This is a great beer.

In Perpetuity,,Connecticut,3.9/5,"Canned on 6/30/23; consumed on 7/11/23

Pours an opaque, dark orange body topped with multiple fingers of thick, fluffy, eggshell-white foam; great head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, large collar, and a dense walling of chunky lacing surrounding the glass.

Aroma opens to a waxy Nelson-dank accented with white grape pith as a flaky cereal grain undertone expands; hints of white peppercorn ease through notes of musty lemon and grass on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste brings mandarin peel, grapefruit, and an underlying hint of key lime as musty white grape meets lemon bubblegum over the mid-palate and a flaky grain lingers on through the profile.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation, dispersing tautness into silky textures as a slight creaminess prevails, leaving a glossy fade through resinous undertones on the finish.

A steady, well-attenuated dankness rife with tropical overlay; a standard NEIPA in the ever-quaffable Tree House rotation.","Jul 11, 2023"
In Perpetuity,,Iowa,4.53/5,"Poured from 16-ounce can into a thin-walled crystal goblet. Hazy pale yellow, with a two-finger white head that left scads of pretty lacing.

Very low bitterness, with hints of citrus zest lingering on the finish. Satisfying mouthfeel, very juicy. Well balanced and very drinkable, i.e. goes down easily and you just want to keep drinking it. First time with Tree House, and I'm suitably impressed. Highly recommended.","Mar 22, 2023"
In Perpetuity,,Connecticut,4.64/5,"Pouts a very hazy yellow-orange color with a thick white head that laces the glass a lot as it fades slowly. Smells of sweet malts, melon, citrus.

T: Tropical and citrusy, but also grassy and even a bit earthy. Mango, tangerine, strawberries and white grapes. THs trademark bubblegum sweetness is very present in the taste as well. Bitter finish, slightly zesty.

F: Full and juicy. Smooth and a bit creamy. Proper carbonation.

In Perpetuity,,,4.57/5,"Look: A mango yellow with a strong white head that dissipates to a glossy surface with a foamy perimeter.

Lacing: A fairly broken soapy lacing. You can tell where each sip ended but no full rings were established.

Body: Literally looks like a glass of orange juice with a subtle head.

Smell: Like a great NEIPA. Subtle and balanced, like a hoppy pine tree accompanied by a well proportioned waft of citrus. A mango/orange backed by hopps smell to be exact. 

Taste: Incredibly smooth, no burn, not pungent but a well balanced bittersweet juice taste with a strong fruity citrus that ends quickly with a smooth slight lactose bitter finish.

Tail end: It leaves you knowing you just sipped a top notch beer. Quite possibly one of the best New England India Pale Ales I have ever drank. Its orange juice water in terms of smoothness. 

After Taste: Almost non existent other then a slight citrus reminder that ends in a very calm cream ending. 

As someone who has drank multiple beers from Treehouse, micro projects to the ninth best beer on this website, I can see how this beer is rated as a 100 after almost 1,000 ratings. This beer is a true diamond in the rough. 

In Perpetuity is a white whale of a beer for any beer advocate on this website, this value grows exponentially as your distance from New England increases.","Oct 23, 2022"
In Perpetuity,,New Jersey,4.49/5,"Fantastic example of a NE style IPA. Look is standard hazy. Nice citrus aroma, but the taste pops big time. Amazing combo of two of my favorite hops - Citra and Nelson. These two combine for a citrus white wine/grape juice taste, but not too sweet.

Alright, finally time to cross another top 250 Tree House beer! This one is currently sitting at #133. I believe this is only brewed once a year so I’m happy to have made it there when they had it available. Let’s crack if open and see what it’s all about

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s a nice bite to the nose in this one, leaning a bit more traditional than they usually do. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe cantaloupe, bready malt, peppery hops, orange zest, resin, mango juice, and light gooseberry

It doesn’t quite have the same bite in taste, but I do like it quite a bit. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, white wine, gooseberry, bready malt, grassy hops, light caramel, pineapple juice, and cantaloupe. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, tangerine, gooseberry, light white wine, and overripe cantaloupe

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and dry beer. Finishes dry and chalky, really different for them but I dig it

In Perpetuity,,Germany,4.6/5,"Pours an entitely hazed orange yellow with a huge, spongy and stable head.

Bursts of passion fruit, ripe pineapples and fresh cut limes, establishing an exotic fruitiness from first glance. Has a white bread dough undertone adding to the hop inspired nose, revealing additional mango, tangerine and white wine grapes. 

Has a soft, smooth mouthfeel to it with a fitting, complimenting carbonation. This has a lighter to medium body with a nice, refreshing effervescence during its finish.

Tastes of ripe mango, luscious peaches and bitter limes, accompanied by an ice bonbon freshness and a noble hop dryness. The beer then develops an intriguing old cheese, ripe oranges interplay with a resinous peak to it, gently balanced by flowery limes and breadcrust malts. Finishes dry and bitter with a vivid fruit basket, lighter and a bit more crisp, creating a great complexity on its way out. 

This is quite unusual for a hazy ipa, making excessivly use of the great Nelson hop, which works marvelously well together with Citra. It‘s creating an unforseen depth which not solely relies on fruit forward flavors, but introducing a cheesy, resinous complexity, even showing off a lighter note of sweet malts. Everything in this comes together in perfect harmony, making you wish for this to last on your tongue in perpetuity.","Feb 16, 2020"

A: Pale tangerine orange with some yellow highlights - hazy - pours with a medium sized, white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some nice lacing

S: Lazy to write, but this really smells like Citra and Nelson - tangerine and orange juice, with some grapefruit and a spritz of lime - floral citrus - some herbal, green, leafy hops - tropical aromas and white grape, white wine - neutral, pale malt at the base

T: Nice amount of citrus, with lots of floral notes and juicy flavors - tangerine, orange, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit - touches of citrus zest, some lime - white grapes, white wine - leafy, herbal, green hops with just a small touch of pine and woodsy character - tropical flavors - low bitterness - pale malt base

M: Medium body, smooth and slightly chewy, finish could be cleaner

O: Because ""Perpetual IPA"" was already taken

I dun goofed and should have tried this before Brighter Than Starlight. At the very least, I can confirm that this shares a lot with Brighter Than Starlight. Citra and Nelson seem to work pretty well together, although the white grape/white wine character that the Nelson is contributing to this beer could be a bit more balanced.","Jan 20, 2020"

Moving right along from the incredible Maple Bacon Coffee Porter I had last night, we now have the imperial version, with an extra 3.1% abv. Maybe the flavors will integrate even better in this beefier beer. Let’s crack it open and find out

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of light tan head that fades to ring and leaves minimal lacing

Yeah it really is similar to the base beer in the nose, just bolder. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, smoky bacon, and burnt caramel

It definitely tastes fuller, and in turn less abrasive than its base. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, light roast coffee, cocoa powder, black cherry, salty bacon, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, smoky bacon, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, tobacco, brown sugar, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry with a balanced sweetness

It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency.

Smells of all the advertized adjuncts, foremost highlighting the beer‘s coffee, which gets even more pronounced by the sweet maple syrup, inheriting an additional blueberry quality. 

Has a slightly creamy, medium body with just enough finely integrated carbonation to add a refreshing note to the beer.

Tastes of toasty, earthy coffee beans, entangled into melting toffee and balancing, sweet maple syrup. Turns even sweeter then, with a smoky hint of sugar glazed bacon, finding a well working antagonist in the multi facetted coffee. Finishes with a coca-cola sweetness, which overpowers everything else, even the coffee, introducing an additional note of rock sugar and no creaminess prevailing.

S: A very enticing aroma of maple syrup, coffee, bacon, malt, caramel, and chocolate.

T: Tasted of a moderate amount of coffee (not as much as I expected), lots of maple syrup, a bit of chocolate (not overly prevalent), mild notes, some malt, and a hint of caramel. This is a big, complex flavor. It's a little weird and chalky in the finish, but it definitely does its job. It's sweet, rich, and quite delicious.

F: A decent amount of carbonation with a somewhat overly dry finish. Full-bodied.

O: Despite some very minor flaws, this is a well done beer. Drinkable.","Oct 30, 2018"
Wide Awake It's Morning,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Appearance - The beer poured brownish black in color with a tan head. 

Smell - Maple and coffee dominated the nose. 

Taste - As expected, the nose was very maple coffee forward. I was disappointed as there was not much bacon. As the taste continued, the coffee grew more bitter in back. 

Mouthfeel - There was so much sticky sweetness with little carbonation. 

Overall - It goes without saying that this is a great beer.","Oct 29, 2018"
Wide Awake It's Morning,,North Carolina,4.62/5,"Dark with a rich creamy tan head. Smells of coffee, smoke, maple and chocolate. Tastes follow the smell. Really sweet and a lot of coffee with the smokiness. Finishes with s char bitterness. Delicious beer.","Oct 25, 2018"
Wide Awake It's Morning,,Michigan,4.46/5,"Blind review. Sent in NBS BIF#8 from roguer. Poured into tulip. Bottled 4/19/18
Pours jet black, rocky mocha head of just about an inch. 
Nose is maple cookies (my stepmom makes these maple cookies, they don’t taste good but they smell amazing), vanilla, hazelnut? Or nuts in general?
Upon first sip, maple for sure, like a lot of maple, maybe more maple, sweetness, strawberry (could be from sweetness) vanilla, lactose sweetness, smoke, pancakes (malts) mild roast, mild coffee. Me trying to breakdown the maple syrup-caramel and/or brown sugar. 
As it warms, strawberry and nuttiness disappears, smoke and slight char become more present. 
The body is medium but smooth with a lingering maple sweetness at the finish. 
From the pour, I let this warm up for 45 minutes or so. I’ve decided that it’s some sort of adjunct (maple bomb) imperial stout/porter from Funky Buddha.","Oct 07, 2018"
Wide Awake It's Morning,,Massachusetts,4.39/5,"03/2015 - so much maple syrup on the nose, plus coffee and bready aromas; incredible iced coffee-like flavors, lovely maple syrup yet not sickly sweet, some lactose, and a bit of salt on the palate; roasty bitterness finishes it off.","Oct 03, 2018"

Wide Awake It's Morning,,Colorado,4.31/5,"this thing is a beast, even more packed with all of these awesome flavors than the maple bacon is, but without the unifying and mellowing barrel elements of the morning wood. big thanks to my homie for bringing this one over for maple beer night, i had not ever seen it before, but have loved its two sister beers! its as thick and dense looking as it seems like it should be, near black but a high luster and some nice thick foamy tan head. it smells more like coffee than anything else, seemingly higher in the proportionality than in the maple bacon, a little less smoke and greasiness and all too, and still with a high maple sweetness element. there is a lot of nuance here too though like black pepper and fresh tobacco and molasses. its as complex in the flavor too, but we are all sort of stunned at how this isnt super insanely sweet. i mean its still way more sugary than you could reasonably drink a whole bomber of, but this is not over the top at all, despite the maple flavor still being really potent in here. nice almost burnt dark malt complexion to even it out, and all the coffee really helps. i didnt catch a bottle date, but the coffee tastes pretty fresh in here to me, and its intensity cuts some of the weight of the body and the sweetness, i like its contribution a lot. the bacon part of this is a little underwhelming, less obvious in the mix than in the base beer, light campfire smoke is all, this isnt meaty or anything to me. a really intense brew, but as good as any of the wildly flavored stouts these guys do. i dont think it needs the barrel. i enjoyed this edition a lot and it was a great end to our epic maple beer night!","Apr 25, 2018"
Wide Awake It's Morning,,Illinois,4.27/5,"22 ounce bottle into a snifter. Had 11/4/17.

Pours dark, opaque, a little thick looking, with a one inch quickly dissipating head and spotty lacing. Aromas of maple, coffee, malt, bacon, caramel, light chocolate and cocoa, some smoke. Smells terrific. The taste also leads with maple, then malt, coffee, caramel, a little molasses, light chocolate and vanilla, somewhat smoky, maybe a hint of bacon. A little salty, not sweet. Smooth, a little creamy, well carbonated, a little bit of a lighter body feel for the style.

Terrific aroma, very good flavor. All the add-ins blend together really well. The maple and coffee are the stars here. If you have the chance when it’s around, grab a couple of bottles. Good price point, too.","Mar 15, 2018"

Wide Awake It's Morning,,Hawaii,4.52/5,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter. Not sure the bottle date.

Pours dark black with a light brown head that is about a finger high. Head slowly disappears leaving some nice lacing.

Aromas of chocolate, maple, coffee, and what I can only assume is bacon. Really interesting nose. Tough to describe properly.

Wow is this rich! Roasted malt, chocolate, salty bacon, maple syrup, and coffee notes. The description on the bottle mentions a smokey flavor and I'm picking that up also. 

Medium body. A little on the thinner side compared to some stouts in this ABV range. 

Overall a really intriguing and excellent beer! Was fun to review. The bacon makes your tastebuds do a double take after the first few sips. This thing is incredibly rich so be warned.","Dec 03, 2017"
Wide Awake It's Morning,,Michigan,3.26/5,"Mostly maple with some coffee. Has a metallic flavor to it. Reminds of waffle crisp cereal, you know, it’s not too bad but leaves an after taste that seems really fake maple.

Blåbær Lambik,,South Carolina,4.35/5,"Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it? The short answer is probably no, but hell it was fun anyways.

Taste is blueberry, with barn funk and had hay. The blueberry is light but not subdued. It plays well with the signature Cantillon funk. Mouth feel is light and perfectly carbonated.

Got to enjoy this in-house at Himmeriget about one month after i picked one bottle up at the release. It is one of the more underwhelming cantillons (tastewise I've tried) for me. Although it is still a very pleasant beer, not quite as good as 2018.","Jul 08, 2019"
Blåbær Lambik,,Ohio,4.22/5,"My first experience of this was at Dark Lord Day, written below. I had a bottle at home so what follows first is my review of that 2018 bottle opened on Zwanze Day 2019. 

Appearance is foggy vibrant burnt red with a tall uneven pinkish-white foam head that slowly settles to a thin film and creamy collar.

Blåbær exhibits tanniny skins and hella oak that has a nutty splintery dusty character. The lambic has an olive brine funk and is more sour than other loons, but it needs to warm up to develop away from vinegar with more pleasant notes of red wine as the prickly semi-dry finish becomes smoother as it warm.

In both experiences, I never really got a definitive blueberry character, but that has been the trend with many other blueberry lambics and saisons I've had across the board.

---

Yep, I got to enjoy this lambic whale at DLD. It was fluffier than I expected, and expressed more oaky barnyard funk than it did fruit, but was quite enjoyable. I didn't flip my shit over it, but I didn't get a full glass of it either.","May 22, 2019"

Pours a hazy maroon body with a light pink head. Aromas are bursting with blueberries and typical cantillon funkiness. Vinous, citrusy, woody, musty. 

On the tongue was tart blueberries and fruit skins, barnyard funk and yeasty, musty basement. Oaky, jammy, tannic, citrus, lactic, lively, acidic.

Some mustiness in there too. Flavors are blueberry abound. Can’t believe how much fruit is present for a 9 year old bottle. Tons of blueberry with some funk. Super balanced.

M: Foremost crisp, clean, and perfectly balanced with a soft yet lively medium feel; earthy component brought forth graciously

Awesome looking beer, dark purple with lots of visible bubbles.

As soon as you open the bottle, the smell of blueberries smacks you in the face. Pouring it and sniffing into the glass shows what a great lambic is all about. The blueberries mingle with sour, funky notes, with hints of raspberries. I could smell this for hours...

Taste follows the nose, very pronounced blueberries with a bit of raspberry, and just the right acidity. 

Mouthfeel is bubbly and lively, way too easy to drink!

S - Aromas of incredible blueberry, berry skin. Excellent light funk, basement and cheesy funk, soft lemons. Really really fragrant. 

T - Taste is similar to the nose, tons of blueberry skin and tannins, loads of funk, cheesy basement. The acidity is nice, but the tannins are a bit too over powering.

Got more berry flavor as it warmed. I've heard this beer is really over-hyped and compared to the other blueberry beers out there I still think this is a very special beer. Maybe bluberry sours in general are just not as flavorful and jammy as raspberry, cherry, apricot, etc. Proabably wouldn't seek it out again but was still a great beer to have.","Sep 19, 2016"

Blåbær Lambik,,Texas,4.63/5,"Pours a rich bluish, purple with healthy blueberry yogurt head. Bottom of cork and nose smells like spontaneous funk with minimal barnyard mustiness but with healthy blueberry aroma. Taste is young lambic citric acidic sourness with big tannic presence, a bit of lacto, and slight but real blueberry undertones. Mouthfeel is full but the finish is very bitter and dry. Overall, this is one of the best blueberry beers I've had but it's a difficult fruit to conquer. Age would tone down the bitterness and let the lambic base come around but would likely diminish the amazing nose and kill the fruit from the taste.

Reviewed: 16 JUNE 2023

A: Pous crystal clear, copper in color, moderate sized bright white head dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. Looks still in the glass’s 4.25

S: Aroma is immediate raspberries, hay and raw wheat. Initially quite floral which then cedes to funky notes of slightly pungent cheese. I can’t say that it smells particularly sour, but there’s some lactic tartness and citrus rind. Quite complex and a wonderful nose. 4.75

T: Taste follows with a big plastic like funk up front, which quickly yields to floral and citrus notes, with big oaky vanilla on the finish that lingers forever. Taste is quite tart and sour but it’s not as puckering as many lambics. The raspberry characters are present but certainly not prominent, not sure to what extent that’s due to the age. 4.5

M/D: Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium bodied with a big but appropriate carbonation and incredible drinkability. I could drink this all day. 5

O: A wonderful beer no doubt. Not sure if it was worth the difficulty in obtaining as I think I prefer Cantillon Rose de Gabrinus when it comes to Raspberry lambics (and I’ve surprisingly found the other easy to get over the years). Regardless, still wonderful and I would have a fridge full of this on the regular if it was readily available. 4.5","Jun 16, 2023"

A- Body is a uniformly hazy orange with a hint of pink. Perhaps sunset in color. There is no head or lacing to speak of.

S- The nose is complex yet simple. Tart raspberries, cheesecloth, funk, oak barrel, breadiness.

T- The flavor is much like the nose- sweet and tart authentic raspberries upfront with a light bready yeast backbone. The finish is quite sour but a softness from the oak barrel lingers on with some sourness long after you swallow.

F- Medium carbonation and a medium weight body. There is a lot of acidity in the body with a light bread yeast feel too.

O- This beer is truly world class. It's the definition of a traditional fruit lambic and it is brewed so carefully and so well. It definitely gets better and you appreciate it more as it goes down. It's quite expensive so if you don't like more traditional sours or you don't like raspberries than don't bother.","Dec 03, 2022"

Some green apple/lemon as well. Flavor is similar but with a malty sweetness that I can't quite describe; almost like someone added a shot of simple syrup. This detracts from the overall flavor profile. Moderate tartness. Moderate funk. Nice fruit. Overall it's solid but not something I'd feel the need to buy again.

At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.

Light carbonation; light body, but not watery; dry, light acidic feel; minor pucker.

Bottle to wine glass. Share with DC.

Muted red orange color, clear, small white head, fades quickly soda-like to lacing. Reforms easily, but is still miniscule. 

Aroma: raspberry, funky yeast and grains, very smooth mix. 

Taste: tart raspberry. Lemon, sour patch kids. Tasty, but can only take so much of it at one time.

Feel: excellent carbonation, light body. A touch sticky.

Framboos,,New York,4.46/5,"Poured from a bottle (bottled 12Sep2019 - #109, 18/19) into an apple wine glass

L: pours a light and clear ruby orange with a moderate very slightly pink-tinted white head that fades after a minute or two. Very minimal visible carbonation, 

S: great raspberry-forward nose, on a slightly funky and tart lambic foundation. Raspberry flavor is fairly sweet, makes me think of raspberry sorbet. Lambic funk has a bit of that barnyard/cheese thing going on, second fiddle to the raspberry (as is the tart aroma for that matter). Cheese funk and acidity ramp up now that it’s hit room temperature, raspberry still there but secondary

T: flips here a bit, would say I get that lambic funk first followed quickly by the raspberry - or at least they’re neck and neck. More tart to open with a bit of cheesy funk at first, followed closely by that sweeter raspberry character from the nose. Medium finish that ends nicely tart and acidic, moderately drying. Once it’s hit room temperature the base beer shines through much more, leaving a yeasty note in the finish I wasn’t getting before. Great balanced oak character

F: medium carbonation, medium- body, medium+ acidity a bit elevated as it hits room temp

O: a delicious fruited lambic, captures the fruit well while staying true to the funky/wild parts of the brew. A pinch on the sweet side at first, as it warms up that mellows with the base lambic shining through more. Overall great, as I expected a delicious Belgian beer","Oct 06, 2020"

Framboos,,Massachusetts,4.5/5,"Priciest beer I've bought to date -- ~$50 in Belgium. Sat on this for about a year awaiting the right occasion, and my friend's bachelor party seemed like a great time to bring it out. Simply put, this is a wonderful lambic that is overflowing with raspberry character. The clean funky-tartness of the base lambic complements the intense raspberry nicely and the drinkability is top-notch, as per usual with 3 Fonteinen. Reminded me a lot of Allagash's Coolship Red, which is a more reasonably priced and (relatively) easily available alternative.

Great,,Rhode Island,4.04/5,"12oz. Bottle served in a Spiegelau snifter. Vintage is probably circa 2014. Pours the color and clarity of unpasteurized apple cider (perhaps a hue darker). Not he, just a thin, broken band around the shoulders. Nose is robust - big hit of figs, followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. Taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. Middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation. Overall, a little past its prime. Not much of a suggestion of the barrel; however, still quite drinkable.","Aug 21, 2022"
Great,,Connecticut,4.44/5,"2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022

Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.

Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge, with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.

Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style.","Mar 24, 2022"

I'm back, baby!

Appearance: 4 - looks like a standard barleywine, but a bit darker and redder. It was pretty clear on the pour but almost completely opaque in the glass.

Nose: 4 - smells like a barleywine on some barrel. A bit fruity. Nothing special so far.

Taste: 4 - still nothing special. It's definitely a very nice barleywine, but I'm not sure why it's so highly regarded.

Mouth: 5 - thick, chewy, and round. A very well-crafted brew.

Overall: 4 - a very fine offering, but not anything I'd write home about. My wife would find it very odd to find a hand-written note about a good but not great BA barleywine.

Great,,Nevada,4.13/5,"Brown and dark amber pour, ultra thin lighter brown head. Aroma knocks substantial whiskey and brown malt notes all over it. Its boozy. But it blends well with the rest of the brown malt, brown sugar, maris otter and said booziness. 

Taste is a sipping experience. Nuts, caramel and toffee all over it. A hint of raisin. I wouldn't say this hid the alcohol, that is pretty much impossible at this abv. But it does what it can. On the back end of the mouthfeel you can pull mild black and tan tobacco notes. Also has a substantial amount of viscosity for a barleywine. It also is on the high end of the spectrum when it comes to stickiness as well. A touch of earth to round it out. While its a very enjoyable beer, I dunno, would just as much if not more prefer something a little easier going like CW or BCS barleywine.

Great,,Germany,4.35/5,"Yields a clean hazelnut brown to ember color with a small, light brown head.

Smells of spicy Bourbon with a hint of coconut among scented wood, wrapped up by dried, sugared wild berries. Very intriguing as for its focussed complexity, sweet and decadent, reminiscent to the complexity of a port wine, also as for its prominent fruit quality on the nose. Offers molasses, glazed caramel and a healthy amount of rock sugars. 

Has a medium bodied mouthfeel, slick and oily, malty and sweet, with a balancing Bourbon dryness, revealing a satisfying warmth.

Offers sweet caramel from the very beginning, lots of toffee and a whiff of licorice round out the foundation of this. Sweet and full, decadently accompanied by a slowly evolving Bourbon appearance. The Bourbon establishes the balance in this, adding an alcoholic warmth and dryness to the flavors, as well as spicy coconut bark. All of this gets perfected by the berries from the nose, ripe and sweet, giving even more depth to the long lasting toffee.

So this is two things for me at the same time - the beer is dangeriusly drinkable, a most enjoyable, flawless sipper. At the same time, this is challengingly complex with lots and lots of layers, all benefitting from each other. On top of this, there is the whiskey barrel, lending not only more omph to the taste but also a very pleasant and needed balance to the otherwise overly sweet beer.","Apr 22, 2017"

I don’t buy much Other Half, since by the time it makes it to my area it’s usually a few months old. That being said, Tavour has been getting me back into them lately with relatively fresh cans. Admittedly, I should’ve gotten around to this one sooner since I’ve had it for a few weeks, but I’m excited to try it regardless. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose is vibrant and tropical, but there’s a nice bitter hop character to it as well. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, lemon zest, overripe cantaloupe, floral hops, bready malt, gooseberry, dank weed, dried blueberry, and light grass

And it manages to keep up that wonderful balance in taste too thankfully. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe cantaloupe, pineapple juice, bready malt, grassy hops, blueberry candy, dank weed, and light orange zest. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, gooseberry, crackery malt, dank weed, grassy hops, pineapple juice, overripe cantaloupe, and light grapefruit zest

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

Light touching head, with ultra fine bright white bubbles. Lots of pill like lacing and even leggy. Island creamy top with a soft shape, sitting on a slightly hazed dark lemon, with hints of noticeable fast rising carbonation.

A bold nose. Dank hits of earth and must hop, but also a real tropical passionfruit like flavor. Hits nice and spicy too, with a bevy of hop explosive power. Nice and diverse but just misses the wow factor, and other beer character balance.

Palate is just real nice. Juiced up and filled with a rich malt coating, hop flavoring of passionfruit, pineapple, and a real jammy like texture. Coats a little chalky but also brings a real nice spicy earthy hop bitterness on the finish. Good notes of tropical variety too, guava, mango all sorts of fruit tropical goodness.

The taste is really nice. For the ABV, way too easy to gulp - I tried not to but a couple got the better of me. Smooth, almost soft, the melon and fruit play dominate roles here, a noticeable malt presence (at least I think that's what it is) and a firm stop by the hops bite before we go into juice territory.

Nose is bold, strong, and bursting with juicy hop notes. Mango, peach, papaya, pineapple, tangerine, and a slight dankness.

Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness.

Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV.

Look is not very hazy for a hazy beer.
Nose is not very pleasant.
Taste is good but not great...nothing exciting...tastes thin and without flavors
Feel is nice but hard to appreciate when the taste is good but not great.
I've had Hop Butcher For the World beers more deserving of the perfect score recently. And Tree House has grown while remaining ""world class"". I don't think Other Half has.
Overall I'd call this a 4.1...or probably a ""score"" of 90.","Nov 05, 2021"

Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,,Ohio,4.33/5,"A peanut sized chunk of something floating at the surface in the neck of the bottle was visible before even popping the cap. Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand.

Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all.

Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing.

Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down.","May 29, 2019"

Breakfast Stout,,Florida,3.84/5,"Almost pure black with a small tan head. The bubbles dissipate pretty fast, leaving just a few smaller ones and some lacing.

Very strong coffee smell. There is a hint of chocolate, helping to balance things a bit

Not surprisingly, there is a strong coffee note up front, then the chocolate sweetness kicks in. There is a lingering bitterness at the finish.

It is a bit thinner than expected, mostly carbonation on the tongue.

I can see how this is the base for the KBS beers, it is pretty solid. With so much coffee flavor, I'd consider this a dessert beer. It's good, but I definitely prefer the KBS variants.","Aug 11, 2023"

Breakfast Stout,,Florida,4.49/5,"12 ounce bottle, poured after warming for 30 minutes, into a Founders snifter.
Dark mud coffee black, fine dense brown head that recedes slowly.
Aroma of Italian roast ground coffee beans and cafe Cubano. A chocolate note too.
Wickedly tasty, leads right off with the coffee. Then char and dark chocolate run around like a marble in the mouth. Finishes mildly sweet, then slightly bitter and dry. 
Oats delivers a fine creamy smoothness. Medium carbonation.

Given all that, I expected to love the #2 oatmeal stout in the world according to the current ranking. Unfortunately, I didn’t. The coffee smell is above average, but the taste is overly bitter and mostly just reminds me of bad coffee that was roasted far too long. This one is not for me.","Jun 24, 2023"
Breakfast Stout,,Ohio,4.75/5,"Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.

Appearance: Very dark brown, nearly black, with a dark tan head so thick that it required multiple gradual pourings to prevent overflowing the glass. Moderate lacing.

Nose: Dark roast, stone fruit, brown sugar, coffee — there’s a lot going on here.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, moderately thick.

Attack: Dark roast, coffee, chocolate, smooth — plenty going on here, too.

Finish: Alcohol, and bitterness from the dark roast that balances everything wonderfully.

Overall: It’s hard to imagine how an American Oatmeal Stout could be any better than this — so full, smooth, and well-balanced. There’s nothing I’d rather drink with Biscuits and Gravy, but it’s also going very well this morning with goetta and scrambled eggs. This beer deserves every bit of its high ratings.","Apr 29, 2023"

Breakfast Stout,,Texas,4.84/5,"Pours an opaque black with a creamy finger thick light brown head which lasts for quite some time. Plenty of lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks average and more on the sudsy side with smaller bubbles (my fav). With a little bit more head retention this would be perfect. It's a beautiful beer on the pour.

Lots of coffee and cacao on the nose with a hint of brown sugar and an excellent floral hop background. A touch of alcohol as well. Excellent.

Taste is very in line with the aroma. Lots of burnt malts, espresso and cacao up front with spicy, floral and pine hoppiness coming through as it sits on the tongue. Bitter toasted cacao nibs after the swallow, along with some burnt oak notes. Very rich and ultimately bitter but with subtle sweetness to balance it out. Love the hop presence which makes itself known but kind of stays out of the way. A true pleasure.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of body. Very creamy and smooth with subtle carbonation. Highly drinkable at 8.3% ABV. A bit of a tongue coater with a little bit if a syrupy feel after the swallow which I think is spot on for the style.

I love a good oatmeal stout and this is one of the best I've ever had, right up there with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. I'd have to do another review of both side by side to truly compare as I originally reviewed that one quite a long time ago. Needless to say, this is a pleasure to drink and a must have if you're a fan of the style. Surprised it took me so long. Cheers!","Mar 09, 2023"

Breakfast Stout,,Ohio,4.24/5,"Quite black with a short, tan head. Small amount lingering. Very roasty aroma with scents of coffee and chocolate. Taste is rich, a blend of coffee and chocolate. Pleasant bitterness, fullness. Small amount of sweetness. Very smooth, silken, delicious. Could be breakfast, could be dessert. Both would be great. It is reminiscent of a coffee drink, like a mochachino or whatever the right goofy name is. It is strong and toasty, almost burned. Mild to modernate carbonation, very well-balanced.

This was a 4-pack gift for Christmas. I always meant to pick this one up, since it's very affordable for the quality, but never found the time. It's a Founders stout, so you know what you're getting.","Jan 12, 2023"
Breakfast Stout,,Canada (AB),4.34/5,"Not sure how I have not reviewed this before - had many times and always a treat.

Smooth full mouthfeel with a lingering bittersweet finish. Simple and superb.","Jan 02, 2023"
Breakfast Stout,,Ohio,4.74/5,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Taste: much like the smell - bitter dark chocolate with a nice mocha finish. Hops are present and well balanced with the other flavors.
Feel: smooth, creamy, rich. Really nice balance with the carbonation.
Overall: this is a great example of an oatmeal stout. Smooth, roasty, chocolaty. Like a high powered cold brew mocha tempered with the smooth creaminess of oats. Fairly moderate alcohol content, but its really well hidden. I don't know about breakfast, but this is a perfect dessert.","Dec 25, 2022"
Breakfast Stout,,New York,4.35/5,"Look: very black, sizable head, recedes slowly (regenerates a little with swirling)
Smell: This is my second bottle (not in one day); milk and coffee, but for some reason this second 12 oz bottle has a definite olive smell to me (is it an off flavor from the coffee or from malt? not sure); slightly sweet chocolate, burnt smores
Taste: More bitterness than you'd expect (mine was bottled two weeks ago); expresso and cappuccino, chocolate, bonfire, finishes bittersweet; I do get that strange olive thing (tried it the next day, seems to have been a fluke); toasted oats, delicious milky froth
Feel: Creamy, but I like it even thicker; it's kind of a coffee stout/ oatmeal stout cross
Overall: It's quite delicious, though I think I was expecting something smoother. Don't drink on an empty stomach; the alcohol really creeps up on you! Great with dessert, like fried bananas","Dec 22, 2022"
Breakfast Stout,,Pennsylvania,4.4/5,"12oz bottle purchased off the shelf from my local grocery store as a single for $2.99. Bottled on 09.15.22, so this is just over three months old.

Look: Pours a rich, very dark brown bordering on black. There is a nice light brown colored head with very fine bubbles that is about an eight of a finger tall. The head regenerates nicely after swirling the glass. It looks very nice.

Smell: The aromas of this beer are laden with chocolate and coffee. It's all the spectrums of chocolate - from lighter cocoa powder to rich, dark baker's chocolate. And there's a constant coffee note that expresses a bit of sweetness as well as a bit of fruity acidity. Some earthy hop notes after swirling the glass. I feel like there are some subtle dark fruit aromas like dark dried cherries that are trying to make their way through the mocha madness. Smells very nice.

Taste: It's really delicious. Very drinkable also. The taste basically mirrors the nose. Up front, it's rich chocolate and coffee that have some sweetness but are overall dry. The finish is dry with bitter, astringent coffee roast along with bitter chocolate malts and roasted barley malts. The finish lingers long. Even though this beer is very dark and bitter, it drinks like a dessert within a glass. I also like that there is some hop expression in this oatmeal stout, but not so much that the beer would be considered ""hoppy.""

Feel: The mouthfeel is nice, it has a smooth, velvety, silky texture. It's medium to full bodied. Soft, gentle carbonation at just the right level.

Overall: It's hard to believe that I have never had this before. Of course, I have had Founder's KBS before yet I guess that I had not been aware of nearly as much hype around this beer. It's a really delicious, drinkable oatmeal stout with tons of chocolate and coffee flavor. It's not sweet, yet could skip dessert and just drink this beer because it's deliciously full, rich, and decadent.","Dec 21, 2022"
Breakfast Stout,,Australia,4.43/5,"Received in a proxy/trade hybrid from @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in November of that year.

L: It looks like a stout. It's jet black. There's a coffee-coloured collar of foam. What can I say - it looks like it's meant to look! 

S: The aroma is bitter chocolate, milky coffee, and burnt charcoal. That burnt note is really enticing and took me a while to work out what it was. 

T: That burnt, bitter note comes through in the taste. It's like sticking your nose into a cooling, coal-fired bbq (a Webber briquette kettle bbq for the Aussies out there). The bitter note combines with burnt chocolate and a hint of coffee and comes out creamy and moreish. This is really enjoyable! 

M: Mouthfeel is smooth and silky but there's also a moderate amount of carbonation that rounds the mouthfeel out perfectly. 

O: This is an excellent beer! It hides its 8.5% ABV really well and belongs firmly in that Belgian category of strong beers that trick you into thinking otherwise. I want another one, but I'm not going to do that to myself just now! 

Cheers!

§ucaba,,New Jersey,4.32/5,"2018 Vintage, sipped on March 24, 2023 in a stout snifter glass.

Dark brown with deep red highlights. A near 1f cap appears briefly before settling to a thick rim film. A few spots of lacing, surprisingly.

Oak aged bourbon and booze aroma up front. Toasted dark bread malts, chocolate, and caramel.

Flavors of bourbon soaked toast and malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, and a touch of cherry wine.

Big and boozy body, yet quite smooth. There’s a light touch of carbonation and the dark chocolate slips in the finish.

An incredibly well aged Barley Wine Ale. A nice tug of war between strong booze and mellow sips.","Mar 24, 2023"
§ucaba,,Texas,4.53/5,"Vintage 2018
Poured from bottle into tulip, good 2+ finger head recedes rather quickly to a small pool, so so lacing. Jet black in the glass, no light gets thru. Big barrel on the nose, caramel, toffee and dried fruits, good nose. Taste follows the nose, big bourbon on the front, big hit of malt sweetness, creamy caramel, some raisin, plum on the tail end and finishes with a good assertive bitterness. Residual bourbon, caramel left on the palate.","Mar 13, 2023"
§ucaba,,Maryland,4.27/5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter.
2018 vintage
Drank January ‘23

Caramel brown with a half inch of short lived tan foam. Some suspended sediment from the second pour. Malty sweet aroma, caramel, bread, dark fruit and some mild alcohol. Tastes much the same, with the addition of toffee/molasses type sweetness and a touch of metallic tang. It is sweet but a clean bitter finish keeps the sweetness well in check. Medium body, low carination, smooth and soft closing with a warm alcohol bite.

This has held up well. But the BA character is gone and I’m guessing some of the hop flavor has disappeared but oxidative flavor, really only a small metallic tang, is low. Drinks easy considering the high ABV.","Jan 07, 2023"

rightfully a classic of the style. The 2018 bottle is very smooth and although I taste the alcohol, it's very easy to drink. The bourbon is definitely there and wonderfully balanced.

Dark, mostly opaque reddish brown, still somewhat see through, tan head.

I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and easy to drink with a low/moderate amount of carbonation.

§ucaba,,Idaho,4.54/5,"No head, hazy caramel brown body. Smell is rich— bourbon whisky dominates, with caramel malt, figs, tobacco, and a healthy rye spice. Taste is more subtle than expected.

In the mouth: here's where it's all delivered, right on the palate. More big, more booze, massive malt, plenty of bourbon, vanilla, cherry, and all the deep, devilish dark fruits aplenty. Yum a dum, dum. I could have sat on this another five years, but I just had to try it now.

§ucaba,,Washington,4.15/5,"Bottle Date: 2018
Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese

Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.

First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this. 

Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.

On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)

At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.

I need to revisit this one.","Feb 21, 2021"

Huge aromas and flavors of caramel, molasses, dark fruit, and licorice, accompanied by notes of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Very sweet and quite boozy, with a little sweetness lingering on the palate.

Art,,New Jersey,4.49/5,"A: The decanter tinges vermilion on the initial impact, which transfers to a vivid – metallic – orange. That luminosity tops a deep saffron base with a pastel orange hue, as gamboge tones streak throughout. Proportionately, an askew cap that comes to a vista white inch, while steadily downsizing to the ½ in, where the palette succumbs a snow drift highlight. The configuration has the hydrophobic polypeptides & bitter acids to modestly cling, when retreating to the ¼ in. At this point, a latticework with a residual nuance to dimly stick, as the retention retains an enacting solidity. Albeit, shy on the aesthetic decree, seeing the descending collar to the minute. The layouts have a transparency upon the transfers, which have an opulent appeal early on, while a circuitous convention develops amid the pressing radiations

S: A density set to esters, as they constantly web around the oak casks, while the grain bill pitches a smart rusticity. There is an isoamyl octanoate innuendo near the persuasive peach accompaniments, which takes a Torani Syrup form. In this respect, a softly tart & fuzzy recording that’s lightly backed, by the oak tannin exchanges, while the hop effect lends a floral regularity. The phenolic compounds gradually characterize on cobwebs, aside a ripened mustiness, given the vintage works over the decant. However, a narrow presentation on the inaugurating course, as the directive is more symphonic to the seeds and skins above the alluding crops. The advancements have a stronger denotation on the aged strains with a grain bill that ties in pit + trench silos, while maintaining a profitable presence on esters. Markedly, a harmonization amongst the ranching & pastoral foregrounds to the milder fruits ascribing pears, berries, and apricots. Moreover, an undercroft ease on the °F upticks, while a dry Torrontés similitude dispatches, besides the barrel aldehydes. The cessations retain an earthed ruralism against the – loitering – eugenol structures, beyond the leathery tannin constitutes

T: Fermentable complexities with a soft cask neatness, which traits ethyl acetates to porous oak codas. Namely, an oxidized kindliness that has a solvent growth under fresh clingstone peaches, which impute seedy connotations per the inferred pits. The French oak barrel offers mild spices to complex polymers, where phenolic aldehydes pitch vanillin. Meanwhile, malt backs the bready accounts with Dorset knobs & pie crusts, as hops back a longleaf pine essence, while ketones casually mingle. Chiefly, an inducement on raspberry ketones alongside strawberries & melons, before connoting emerald drop pluots. A buildout on fleshed fruit to palm syrup, as catacomb dust delicately descends on Golden Silk Spiders. Coupled with, cattle yard atmospheres to leathery tannins, as a transferred aridity elevates above the rustic granularities. The timing to weather – over the course – reverberates that inaugurating solvency thru an Oloroso Sherry implementation, which offers an oxidative nuttiness to exotic thickets. On the rear side, a perceptible murmur on cloves & nutmeg, while guaiacols quietly coat the codicils over smoke, as polyphenol compounds dictate

M: There is a passing rain to flagstone texture, from a minerality component that later transcends on seafronts. The surface is soft with calm acidic natures, given the modest vivacities, which attenuate steadily. In consequence, a dry formation that benefits over the cask scriptures, when depicting the hydrolysable substances

O: Yeast grandiosities that are perceptively backed across the bitter – earthy – hop effects, while phenolic companions lurk. On balance, a sensitive malt mannerism with a loyal intention to not annihilate the course, as the French oak barrels impress. The timetables are advantageous to the vintage over an improved dryness, from cut sugars to cranked up/interconnected esters","Dec 23, 2022"

Art,,Pennsylvania,4.9/5,"Batch 4, bottled 5/21/2015. 

Appearance - Pours a pale straw yellow that is slightly opaque, but you can vaguely see through it. It's golden hue resembles more a glass of Chardonnay than beer, but the narrow, dense, snow-white head gives it away. What the head lacks in height it more than makes up for in retention, as it never fully dissipates; even when it finally sinks, it coats nearly the entire surface with a thin film of foam.Bubbles of carbonation lackadaisically rise to the surface every now then, but they are sparse.

Aroma - The aroma is a blend of fresh-cut grass, lemon peel, nectarines, subtle graininess, and finally a burst of white grapes at the end. It is altogether cohesive and summons and subtle tartness that ties everything together. The fruitiness of it makes it infinitely refreshing to smell, and the acidity coupled with the almost tropical-like fruit blend is nearly flawless in execution. The barrel is integrated seamlessly, with waves of oak, vanilla, and finally the wine itself washing over the other notes without overpowering them.

Taste - After my first sip, I was surprised at how acidic Art actually is compared to what I perceived in the aroma; to be fair, in contrast to other beers it isn't overly acidic, but it came across more than I expected. After a few more tries to acclimate, it's easier to swallow. The grape-lemon zest combo is still king and why not, since it is so good? Lemongrass and the grains come next to light the load, before finally the fruits emerge again to carry this to the finish. The tartness kicks the flavors up to a whole new level. The wine is a bit more present here and it contributes a slight booziness that oozes into the other flavors to give them that barrel-kissed feeling. The vanilla falls away here, leaving the oak to drive home the barrel notes.

Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is probably the only thing I can fault Art on, in my opinion. I was expecting more carbonation based on the style, but it falls pretty low on spectrum, and a bit more would've made this even better. Otherwise, this is very nice. It is light on the palate and is just dry enough to make it super refreshing. 

Closing Arguments - As my first foray into Hill Farmstead's barrel-aged program, and really, to the brewery itself (I've never really tried many of their beers even though they are always on my radar ever since I had Ephraim way back in early 2011), I didn't know what to expect with Art. Happily, I can easily proclaim this is near the top, if not the top, of my saison list. It is flawless in almost every way besides the carbonation, and I could drink this endlessly - especially in the summer heat.","Jun 17, 2016"
Art,,Massachusetts,4.31/5,"Pours a rich golden grain. Minimal white foam. Vinous funk aroma. It's soft and delicate, lightly tart, vinous but subtly so. A little cheese funk comes out as it warms.

S - lime rind hits the nose first followed by green apple. As it warms start to get a hay/barnyard aroma and the oak comes though nicely. Additionally the hop sent develops as it sits. With a deep breath can get hits of ethenol. 
T - it has been some time since I have drank regular Dorothy, but remember it not being my favorite due to the bitterness. Initially get hop bitterness on the tip of the tounge. This is followed by a fantastic light barnyard funk. Finishes with citrus and citrus rind bitterness and the oak does start to come through the more I consume. Very slight acidity. I do get minerality. 
F - absolutely plays on the tounge. Light, effervescent and does not coat the tounge at all. 
O - for being the easiest of the ancestry series, I think I could try to get more bottles. It is very complex and unlike the non BA version I enjoy the bitterness immensely","Feb 16, 2019"
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),,Ohio,4.17/5,"Sparkling clear yellow-gold with a tall bright white foam settling to a persistent blanket with a slight cling at the edges.

Smell is hay, straw, wild herbs and orchard fruits with a touch of toasted oak and a hint of lime rind.

Taste is grassy hay, lemon and apple, with more brett forward funk and bitterness than regular. Tart and crisp with a tingly semi-dry swallow, a touch of woodiness comes out on the exhale. Overall very well balanced and extremely drinkable.

This isn't the drastic transformation from the base that other barrel aged Hill saisons are, and it's barely more tart. Considering Dorothy is a stellar beer in its own right, I'm still very satisfied with this sip of sunlight on this uncharacteristically sunny Northeast Ohio day.","Dec 14, 2018"
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),,Massachusetts,5/5,"B2 April 4, 2017

pours out a mostly clear brilliant golden straw color, creamy bright white head with suds atop and great retention. aromas of lemon, hay, fresh cut grass, floral, oak, mellow earthy funk, spice and bright citrus peel in there. on palate there is the above mentioned notes with even more depth and coherence. quite a pungent hit of fruity citrus and fuzzy peach flavor dancing in there, almost invoking characteristics of a NEIPA. but there is this beautiful funky dryness and oak character to balance it out. hay, fresh cut grass, lemon peel, musty grape skin, white grape, mellow acidity, oaky sweetness hinting at vanilla. the feel is so effervescent and crisp, wonderfully complimenting the flavor profile.","Nov 30, 2018"

Aromas of funk, oak, hay and subtle acidity fill my nose. Not much of a farmhouse aroma here as I feel like the barrel aging did away with that. Taste is divine. Tart, oaky, subtle acidity in the finish. Muted layers of farmhouse here but not very prevalent. Feel is light and bubbly. Almost champagne like. Damn good. Overall, this is an outstanding brew. HF already makes world class non BA saisons and when you toss them into a barrel, they elevate to a whole new level.","Oct 03, 2018"

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),,Massachusetts,4.71/5,"A- 750ml bottle into a small chalice with a mostly clear golden body and a thick frothy white cap. Good head retention and a fluffy ring remains at the edges. Thick sheets of lace form at each sip.

S- Hill Farmstead terroir with some added hops, such an amazing combonation. Lactic tartness from the bigs with notes of underripe stonefruit, passionfruit, apricot, Bretty barn funk, vinous oak and a very slight acetic hint. Bright and balanced between the hops and bugs.

T- The hops provide some more balance here as the Brett goes up and the lactic bacteria goes a bit down. Herbal, floral and fruity (stone/citrus) hops with lactic yogurt, fresh crushed wheat, vinous wet oak, vanilla oak degradation and underripe tart apricots. Horsey and a bit barney but still balanced wonderfully.

MF- Light body with a solid frothy texture and a high level of carbonation. A hint of slickness and a tart ending.

The base beer gets some vinous oaky feels. Wonderful balance between all of the elements and the barrel suits one of the best HF beers there is.","Dec 18, 2017"
Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),,Germany,4.91/5,"Pours a cloudy golden color with a huge, froth head.

Smells very promising and complex - the nose is filled with dried herbs, lemon zest and a note of orange juice, as well as white bread dough and wet hay. There is a cookie sweetness coming from the hay, which gets almost entirely swallowed by the tart lemon presence, but manages to cut through. A whiff of old basement, together with some wooden mold establish a fantastic counterpart to the bright fruitiness.

Has a soft and light mouthfeel, which got a well nuanced sparkly, mineralic carbonation to it, which becomes most present during the finish, lending a well deserved refreshing note to the beer.

Tastes of ripe wheat, which gets immediatly overpowered by tart lemon and juicy orange, together with a slowly evolving herb dryness of mint and oregano, which turns even more prominent in the finish. Maintains a very pleasant, mellow mouthfeel, which gets complimented by a sparkly, well dosed mineralic carbonation, adding to the dryness. Its cookie sweetness from the nose, together with some subtle blue cheese funk, create a wonderful complexity, which does not distract from the lemon at all.

That is an incredibly well made, complex and tasty beer, it is mindblowingly good. All aspects come together in perfect order, enriching each other, balanced by the fantastic mouthfeel.","Sep 04, 2017"

Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),,New York,4.57/5,"This one pours a mostly clear golden sunshine yellow, with a small head, and a very small amount of lacing.

This smells like chalky, minerally funk, with lots of citrus- mostly lemon lime and white pepper.

This tastes pretty good, but it's surprisingly mellow. It's a slow sipper, complex, and doesn't bash you over the head with a farmhouse anvil. I get sour lime, white wine, minerally funk, sweaty Brett, and grapefruit. There's much less of a hop presence here than the normal Dorothy, which is not surprising.

This is surprisingly creamy and soft, with a huge level of drinkability.

Pirate Bomb!,,Texas,3.61/5,"12 oz. bottle, marked 07/27/19, sampled 05/09/21. A little long to wait, bought it off the shelf 3 weeks ago, so the brewer takes any hits on aging, they left it there for purchase. 

Appearance: Black glass, thin halo of tan bubbles, no lacing.

Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.

Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.

Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.

Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky.

Pirate Bomb!,,Oklahoma,4.25/5,"On tap - this is the July 2019 batch, so 15 months old.

Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing. 

Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it. 

Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should.

Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts. 

Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through. It’s not the best, but far from the worst, and very consistent across the board.","Oct 15, 2020"

TASTE: cocoa. Coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper kick is just right. Very tasty.
FEEL: full bodied, light carbonation, sticky on the tongue which allows the pepper to linger just nice.

Very special stout. Glad I have 2 more of these to age since in general I've found rum BA to need a bit more time than Bourbon BA to mellow out.

Excellently done, I'd previously enjoyed a 14% version (2019 if I'm not mistaken) of this brew on tap, and had found it enjoyable. I find this bottled version (15%) with slight age to be even greater than the first; the chillies are more prominent, but the body still packs plenty of rich chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. The chillies generally save their heat until the finish; while the rum notes come to increased prominence over the chocolate as the brew warms. The mouthfeel I find to be moderately thicc, though not as much as one might expect from a such a high gravity stout; present but not in a weighty manner. Overall the flavor is reminiscent of a a delicious & spicy chocolate sweet bread enjoyed alongside coffee heartily spiked with rum. Cheers!","Jul 28, 2020"

Pirate Bomb!,,Illinois,3.26/5,"Pirate Bomb is one of the many variants from Prairie. PAA is one of my all time favorite breweries and I cannot get enough of Prairie Noir and Vanilla Noir.

However, I was shocked to find that Pirate Bomb was so off the mark. The rum is insanely overpowering on the nose and especially on the flavor of the beer. I felt like I poured the beer and than a shot of dark rum into a glass. I know they were going for a rum kick, but this was out of control.

The sweetness of the beer is quite good but after a few sips, the blanket of rum becomes unbearable.

Wonderfully put together, the rum and extra vanilla notes kick it up a notch and make it a better version of the original Bomb!.

The taste is where this one really excels. If you enjoy the original Bomb! and appreciate rum, then like me this brew is for you. The extra vanilla, cocoa and coffee bring more flavors and deeper components that let the sweet coconut and roasted malts tie it all together without actually being cloyingly sweet. This masked the ABV perfectly, but there was a little heat from the chillies. Like the nose the combo was dynamic, with dark rum, coconut, dark chocolate, woody notes, chocolate syrup, vanilla, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, piney accents, molasses, toffee, espresso, chili peppers and some minor metallic aspects.

Grey Monday,,Massachusetts,4.31/5,"2021 vintage

I’m an absolute sucker for hazelnuts in a Stout, and when I see that The Bruery has one, it’s an instant buy. Plus it’s also another top 250 list tick. This is a big ass bottle that I’ll likely be attacking all night so let’s stop wasting time and get right into it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Right off the jump, there isn’t much hazelnut present in the nose, but it’s still interesting nonetheless. I’m picking up on aromas of molasses, earthy bourbon, peat smoke, sea salt, cocoa powder, toasted hazelnut, dry oak, light vanilla, and raisin

The hazelnuts definitely express a bit more in taste, though they still aren’t exactly at the forefront. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting cocoa powder, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, toasted oak, black cherry, burnt caramel, vanilla, sea salt, and smoky tobacco. The swallow brings notes of dark chocolate, earthy bourbon, toasted hazelnut, sea salt, peat smoke, sea salt, molasses, dry oak, burnt caramel, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks significantly below its abv. Like literally less than half and that’s easily the most impressive part of this one

I struggle with this one. It’s definitely not top 250 material, and the adjunct isn’t really the star, but on the other hand it’s (dangerously) drinkable and pretty unique. Worth a shot for sure","Jul 04, 2023"
Grey Monday,,Indiana,4.2/5,"750mL bottle, 2021 edition sent to new Society members under their new nationwide shipping policy. Very little difference from the base Black Tuesday, if I'm honest, having had regular BT many times but this being my first Grey Monday. That means it's excellent, but the hazelnut treatment is pretty muted at this point (if it was ever more prominent), yielding a slight generic nuttiness with a touch of additional sweetness. It's not Nutella, that's for sure. It also suffers the same shortcomings of the standard BT, being very thin on mouthfeel for the ultra-high ABV and pretty hot on bourbon heat once it warms up a bit.","Jun 16, 2023"
Grey Monday,,New York,3.76/5,"Pours a very dark brown though with moderate light clarity on the edges. Fizzy cola head that quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Nose has a hint of hazelnuts right off the bat before giving way to big waves of whiskey and rum, molasses, dark soy sauce, barley, oyster sauce, and vanilla. Flavor is a little tough to place. Heat - both warming booze and sharp ethanol - pop right away. There's significant salinity that's different from Black Tuesday - less deep, blackstrap molasses, more brackish sea spray or even oysters. Malts, soy sauce, black licorice are there, but with less intensity than BT. The nuts come forward as it warms, and though it's hard to definitively place hazelnuts, they would be a guess along with peanuts and hazelnuts - definitely nothing too fatty like a walnut. Mouthfeel is remarkably thin for this kind of beer (I'd call it ""moderate""), especially when compared to BT or a BCBS. That's not bad per se, but I think the feel contributes to the overall heat and sharpness. This was interesting - though I'm not sure I'd be keen to shell out for another bottle.","Mar 30, 2023"
Grey Monday,,Ohio,4.47/5,"750 ml bottle, bottled 05/31/19, 19.2% ABV. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long. Not much lacing, either. I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, fudge, hazelnuts, brown sugar and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some burnt/charred malt, caramel and earthy/oaky flavors. It's a little more roasty/bitter tasting than I was expecting, but that's not a complaint by any means. All the flavors seemed well balanced with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be.

The beer pours very little head and the beer itself is a dark brown color with a bourbon like appearance.

The taste still has the hazelnut note but the chocolate is more forward and dominates the taste alongside the alcohol note.

Flavor profile is raisins, figs, toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, molasses and syrup with hearty roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely and bready malts. It's thick, thick and thick. Drinking a boozy cookie. Bourbon adds heat that seems in and lingers long after the malts wash away. A touch of char adds a little grounding bitterness for the sugary initiation.

Grey Monday,,Pennsylvania,3.94/5,"Received from @2beerdogs in NBS BIF 10 – Thanks Derek! Reviewed 1/26/20.
“2018 Edition”. Etched on the shoulder above the rear label “B#573 6/25/18” above “11:19 005479”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 55 degrees (as stated on the label) in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 62 degrees F.
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Medium brown, clear.
Body – Dark brown/black, opaque. When held to direct light, a very deep red-amber, translucent. No legs.
Head – Large (Maximum four cm, aggressive center pour), tannish with large bubbles nosily popping, gone within a minute after the pour is completed, leaving thin partial ring of tiny bubbles, fed by effervescence. While not fizzy, the head demonstrates no tendency to last. At 18.9% ABV, this is not surprising. 
Lacing – None, again 18.9% ABV.
Aroma – 4 - Has an almost watery raisin aroma with some weak wood and possibly bourbon in the background.
Flavor – 4 – The flavor is somewhat elusive, starting slightly sweet and a bit fruity, without bourbon, oak, or hazelnut. The nasal raisins seem to be dominant. No alcohol (18.9% ABV as marked on label) aroma or flavor, but massive numbing of the tongue and soft palate as it warms while being held in the mouth. Alcohol on the exhale. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide, no hops.
Palate – 4 – Medium, just short of syrupy, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4. The appearance in unremarkable, looking like any headless imperial stout. The aroma is most like Flying Dog’s Raison D’Etre, at least to my burnt-out lab nose. In the flavor I find no hint of hazelnuts, oak, or bourbon, just a generic sweetness with a hint of DARK FRUIT, something I didn’t taste (other than raisins) until I was typing this summary. Palate feels good, but I’ve corked the bottle after one glass, so I don’t wake up with my head on the keyboard and beer leaking onto the motherboard (Incidentally, Mrs. Lizard has miraculously appeared and approved the corking of the bottle for later. Maybe today I won’t sleep through Noir Alley!) Overall, I’ve probably rated this too high, but it’s from The Bruery, so, by definition, it HAS to be a superior brew.","Jan 26, 2020"
Grey Monday,,California,4.51/5,"2015 bottle poured into a snifter

A: Pours nearly black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little spotty lacing.

S: Liquid candy bar, milk chocolate, hazelnut, bourbon, a bit of spice, brown sugar, vanilla, faint oak, and a nip of alcohol on the back end.

T: Roasty, big milk chocolate, smooth bourbon, nice hit of hazelnut, brown sugar and toffee, vanilla, a little spice, a bit of oak, and a touch of alcohol poking through, though not unpleasant. 

M: Full body, mild carbonation, a little warmth, yet creamy smooth.

O: The Bruery doing what they do. Massive brew, but well balanced. Not complaining about this being a 1 and done. It's aged beautifully.","Nov 28, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Idaho,4.36/5,"750 ml bottle at share, courtesy of Toby. Pours out the normal, but nice retention on the head gives it a better look. Aroma is nutty, but a bit too much like flavoring and not real nuts. Still good. Lots of vanilla, chocolate, roasty notes on top of a velvety feel. Really superb, and aged well.","Nov 01, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Connecticut,4.35/5,"No head retention. Fairly clear and pale, more like a strong ale than stout.

Nose is almost all booze and brown sugar. No hint of hazelnuts.

Brew is nutty on the palate, especially up front, followed by waves of brown sugar, grapes, dates, chocolate, oak, raisins, bourbon, and lots of boozy heat.

Hot, big, boozy, and proud of it. This is a warming sipper that presents its booze well.

Like the best, most complex Bruery beers, this is reminiscent of Utopias. I definitely feel it’s more of a strong ale, as I don’t get much of a stout feel to this.","May 20, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Washington,4.4/5,"Tried 2015 in 2017. A heavy one for sure. Hazelnuts are my favorite, but I barely picked them out. Nevertheless it was a tasty brew which I may have enjoyed more than its boozy Black Tuesday cousin.","May 09, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Minnesota,4.47/5,"Good lord is this a boozy beast.

I decided, probably in error, to drink a bottle by myself on a Tuesday evening. I had two Grey Mondays gathering dust in my cellar - and no one ever wants to open these at shares, so I thought I might start thinning the herd. Full disclosure: I only finished one glass before falling asleep.

Appearance brings to mind a barleywine, more than a stout - Grey Monday pours a deep reddish brown and smells tremendously boozy. Seriously, this stuff makes my head swim. Hazelnuts are faint in the nose, but there's definitely a bit of warm nuttiness there. It's quite sweet and fairly sticky, thick, and oily. 

While Bruery stouts aren't my every day go-to, it's difficult to deny them accolades - these beers are nuts. Delicious, but they just aren't practical when drinking alone!","Apr 10, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Ohio,4.64/5,"2016 bottle. Pours black with beige head. Huge caramel, hazelnut and cocoa aroma. Taste is still a little boozy but good for its ridiculously high ABV. Lots of hazelnut on the flavor with molasses, caramel, butterscotch, cocoa, bourbon. Delicious huge beer. Definitely a sipper.","Apr 08, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Illinois,4.75/5,"Bottled 9/24/13; drank 8/8/15 @ Harvest Hop Haus. 

Muddy brown/purple appearance. 

Minimal dark tan head; no lace. 

Raisin, caramel & faint booze heat notes in the nose. 

Thick mouthfeel. 

Milk chocolate, port, sweet caramel & molasses flavors; no booze heat. 

Insanely drinkable considering the a.b.v., this is a sweet dessert treat that isn't cloying. A triumph of the brewer's art.","Mar 31, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Missouri,4.27/5,"L: pours clear brown without a head but is thin and black in the glass
S: bourbon, hazelnuts, chocolate...big sweetness. Smells delicious 
T: yum, just like the nose it has the bourbon and chocolate hazelnuts all working together. This vintage is 20.0% and it is smooth. Never would guess it. But it soo sweet, only a few oz in a sitting is drinkable.
F: a bit thin like the pour suggested but sticky sweet. 
O: great beer but only can drink it on small quantities","Feb 08, 2019"
Grey Monday,,Alabama,3.93/5,"2017 Release. 20.0% ABV.

The pour is a dark brown with a distinct crimson hue. Hardly any head appears, but what does bubble up is a nice ivory color. Thin and spaced out, quick to disappear. 

As was expected, this thing is BOOZY, with lots of dark fruit right away on the nose. As it warms, bourbon and oak come forth with some urgency. The booze is still overwhelming, but the subtly complex aromas that come peeking through that ethanol are pleasant, and chocolate in particular becomes gradually more prevalent.

In the flavors you get more of that powerful booziness, but it is not as overwhelming as the nose. Oak and bourbon is noticeable, with that stinging alcohol quick to follow it up. As it warms, you get some nuttiness, but can’t really pick out hazelnuts specifically. Hazelnuts are one of those nuts that can be potent in a beer, but even just a year bottle conditioning with an ABV that high can swallow up some of the originally intended components. 

The body on Grey Monday is thin, but with a syrupy feel and a low carbonation. Sharp, stinging booze is present throughout and makes for a hot finish. Closer to the liquor end of the spectrum than beer, honestly.","Dec 30, 2018"
Grey Monday,,Germany,3.45/5,"Grey Monday '14 on 181225

Pours an oily almost black color with no head at all.

Smells of honey, scorched malts, spicy molasses, toasty oak and a faint hint of heated hazelnuts.

Offers no carbonation at all, the beer itself has a thinner mouthfeel with a relatively well working boozy edge.

Tastes of alcohol soaked praline, caramel and a touch of toasty hazelnuts. Brings a huge rock sugar impact to the palate, effectivly dissolved in the licorice and scorched malts. Offers a pleasnt milk chocolate flavor, covered in caramel and maintaining, dry, not sharp oak. 

This is pretty good for a liqueur and very strange for a beer. Drank it with five persons, none too many.","Dec 30, 2018"
Grey Monday,,Minnesota,4.62/5,An aroma of booze and hazelnut. A bit of heat in the taste but with this high ABV how could there not be? I like the mild carbonation. This is creamy goodness. I even loved the aroma they put in the wax!,"Dec 26, 2018"
Grey Monday,,Rhode Island,4.1/5,"2017 vintage. Pours a deep mahogany with a tight band around the shoulders. Nose reveals hazelnut, cocoa, butterscotch and spirit/ethanol. Taste expresses butterscotch, cocoa, ethanol and a hint of soy sauce. Mouthfeel is fairly light with a lively carbonation. All and all - drinkable and ABV is dangerously well-hidden; however, I think another year in the cellar might be the sweetspot.","Dec 02, 2018"
Grey Monday,,Indiana,4.21/5,"Pouring from a 2016 750 ml. bottle into a snifter. This beer pours out very light in color for the style, just like the rest of the series. Doesn't form a crown, only an outer ring of bubbles attaching themselves to the glass. The smell is big boozy raisins and plums with slight chocolate as well. This whole series has had huge dark fruit notes. It just smells like you're going to get drunk. The taste comes in hot with booze and the dark fruit remains. This is the version aged on hazelnuts, but honestly how would you ever know with a beer this boozy? I do think I like this one better than the rest, but they just still don't hold up to the caliber I thought they would bring.","Nov 03, 2018"
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,,Thailand,4.16/5,"Pale, yellow, thick and juicy looking, so hazy, you can’t see through it! Topped with one finger of fast dissipating, white head. The smell is of orange, citrus, a hint of pine. Certainly not as pronounced as I was expecting. The taste is very fruity and juicy, like a perfect refined, orange juice, with a hint of dank Ness, and an abundance of tropical notes but all very muted. Light and foamy, feeling body, very smooth! I’ve been anticipating this brew for a long time I got it at beer hub in Waynesville North Carolina and I’m drinking in Maggie Valley August 12, 2023. I must admit the hype around this set my expectations quite high, and it is a great beer. However, not nearly as perfect as I was expecting. But certainly worth searching out.","Aug 12, 2023"
King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,,Michigan,4.29/5,"Poured the requisite opaque yellow orange with a growing manilla colored head. No floaties to be seen.
The aroma is lost on my Covid damaged nose. Stupid Covid.
The taste was a tale of two beers- at first it was magnificent with citrus notes and a hint of piney pith. I’m thinking this is awesome!
Then I let it warm up a bit and it shifted to a dryer, more pithy taste. No idea why, it was still really good, just not magnificent.
The feel is solid, smooth and no chunks of anything. Easy quaffing.

Smell...A burst of orange, pineapple, pink grapefruit, mango, and all types of floral aromas. a dank grass is fielded by the dry hopping imbibing a pungency
Taste...Orange bitter pineapple express with the dank hoppy bitterness with the dry component i believed caused by the dry hopping
Feel...An astringent juice feel with a sticky convergence of foam . Great carbonation launching a good fullness. 
Overall...This beer I tried today for the 4th time is one of the elite beers i get to try. Sometimes a beer just hits you and says WOW and this for me has that quality. King Sue its close cousin I felt the first time i had that too!! If you see this beer and like unfiltered DIPas you would be a fool not to pick this up.

Beer poured a hazy light golden orange with an okay white head.

Nose is very nice, citrus and tropical fruit forward.

Taste is a light but substantive pale malt base that allows the hops to shine thru and that they do. Very flavorful with orange, papaya, and mango shining through. Finishes with a touch of grapefruit and some major pith; 7/10 on my bitterness scale.

Mouthfeel is ultra-light and very refreshing.

Snuck over to Bottlecraft specifically to look for this beer as I saw earlier in the day it wasn’t at Windmill Farms. Found it along with three others to make an even 4-pack. TG’s website called this “Citra hops give King Sue its bold flavors of mango, orange, and pineapple. This double dry-hopped version packs even more flavor into each bottle.” Was really looking forward to this one.

Poured a light golden hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of frothy white head. Could see lots of bubbles coming up along the sides of the glass, kind of looking like a snow globe. Almost perfect spiderweb foamy lacing. Almost perfect foamy retention. (Sight - 4.75)

Smelled Citra, pineapple, grapefruit, Tang, orange, citrus zest, mango and guava. Even better out of the can with many orange citrusy flavors. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted just as good as the nose. In order got Citra, pineapple, red grapefruit, Tang, tangerine, blood orange, mango, papaya, guava, citrus pulp, citrus zest, lemon and lime. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Long, citrusy finish. (Feel - 4.50)

This was excellent overall and I slightly underrated it. A little better (4.36) than the regular version (4.29) for me). (Overall - 4.50)

Smells of tangerine, clementine, orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple, tropical fruit, wet citrus hops, bread crust, biscuit, faint caramel, hints of flowers and some peach as it fades.

Tasted like it smelled with the additions of honeydew melon, graham cracker, honey, lime, mint, tea leaf, coriander and some light peppery spices as it fades. The flavor is much more balanced than the aroma, and this had a very smooth mouthfeel while hiding the ABV. A really easy drinking beer that was really flavorful.","Nov 25, 2022"

Scent is pineapple, grapefruit, mango and citrus with some pine resin.

Taste is tropical fruit - mango, papaya, pineapple. Citrus - lime, oranges, grapefruit. There is a hint (just a hint) of pine resin. Some green melon. Seems like a touch of alcohol esters.

Our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth, even for a mythically legendary beer like this, but I have high hopes and great trust in the Belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations. And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength. But the taste is spicier, and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose, it expresses more like a mole with that kick.

Cork seemed to have dried out, when I opened the bottle some of the beer was on the inside of the cap, the cork was all wet.

Orange color with a white head that diminishes quite fast (I guess because of the open air cork?)

Lou Pepe - Gueuze,,Hong Kong,4.5/5,"A 750ml bottle at Nüetnigenough. 2013 sticker, bottled on 27th April 2015. Poured into a Cantillon tasting glass.

Appearance: It poured a clear golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly and left some sparse lacing.

Aroma: Apple, floral, lemon, hay, grass, barnyard with a touch of light funk.

Taste: Quite similar to the aromas with apple, lemon, grass, hay, floral, sour, light vinegar and funk.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with high to moderate carbonation.

Overall: A great gueuze. Loving the Lou Pepe varieties from Cantillon. A refreshing spritzy gueuze that is very easy to drink.","Aug 23, 2016"

L: Pours an opaque orangeish yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

S: Ripe orange and grapefruit with some piney, woody hints. A bit of mango as well.

L -- Hazy golden orange in the glass with the usual fluffy HF head that lasts and retains wonderfully
S -- Mango sorbet, orange juice, yellow grapefruit zest, lightly creamy oat malt, and a light berry note 
T -- Wave of pithy yet creamy citrus pith, citrus flesh, and dried blueberry, followed by a moderate earthy bitterness that is pronounced but rounded. Light malty sweetness makes for a nice tapering finish that continues to be lightly bitter
F -- Soft, fluffy, drinkable
O -- A hair more bitter than my favorite S&S variants. Still fantastic, as expected

T: Very mellow bitterness, big ripe mango, citrus and pine flavors with a clean malt backbone. The yeast seems to be contributing some fruitiness as well.

F: A dry, moderate body and a crisp, low-carbonated finish.

Drunk on expiry date - but that’s a (properly) short 6 week dating. Like all the greats, hits in stages. Gets all the best out of Mosaic (except maybe berries, but also no onions) as you’d predict. But what’s really shining through is the texture; it’s like Panna it’s so soft. No sharp edges; you need to pay attention to appreciate this one. But so worth it.","Oct 25, 2019"
Society & Solitude #6,,New York,4.25/5,"Pours a hazy beige color with notes of orange. A big thumb length head retains well and yields rings of lacing.

The aroma displays several indicators of mosaic hops. Notes of berries, citrus, bubblegum, mango and peach. On the herbal end, there are aromas of grass and pine, subtle and significantly pungent like some of their other offerings.

Sweet and juicy with a medium bodied, frothy and smooth mouthfeel. The fruity flavors mostly align with the aromas, except that flavors come into play as well. A malt backbone that includes wheat and oats contribute to the creamy texture complimented by the gentle carbonation. Mild notes of pine and grass add a gentle spice. The finish is dry with flavors of spiced bubblegum.

Not as intense as some of the other Society and Solitude offerings. Just smooth and flavorful easy drinking","Oct 24, 2019"

Society & Solitude #6,,Minnesota,4.56/5,"Canned on 9-9-19, consumed on 9-21-19. Best buy date 10-21-19.

Pours a creamy, murky, dank looking pale orange color. 1 finger white, frothy head. The head retention is good, and there's a nice ring of lacing on the glass as the head dissipates. 
The nose is quite juicy smelling. Citrus from the hops is the main aroma. Pineapple for sure. I think I'm getting mango also. More of a tropical feel to the aroma.
Taste - It's just a very citrusy beer. The Mango and pineapple are there. It finishes as more of a pine flavor.
Very creamy, and soft feeling. The hops linger, and stick in my throat.

Society & Solitude #6,,Canada (ON),4.4/5,"Canned 07/23/19. Enjoyed 08/21/19. Pours a thoroughly hazy light straw colour with fluffy off-white head. Head lasts quite a while and there are significant sheets of lacing during drinking. Aroma isn't huge but has a nice citrus, melon hop aroma along with almost a white grape / wine characteristic of some Brut IPAs I've had recently. Was some Nelson Sauvin used along with the ""almost entirely"" Mosaic? Taste follows the nose with hints of sweet orange juice, melon, pineapple, and again that slight white wine. I say all hints because this is not a huge juice or hop bomb, but rather just a well crafted balanced IPA with many subtle flavours and nothing to blow your socks off or take over the taste. Some grassiness and sweet tartness appear at the end of the sip along with just a hint of non-astringent bitterness to let you taste those hops right to the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately full. This is a very nice IPA, not as big of a taste as I've grown to enjoy, but refreshing & very enjoyable nonetheless.","Aug 21, 2019"

Society & Solitude #6,,Colorado,4.46/5,"absolutely incredible ipa here, the original style vermont ipa, before everything had to get all messed up. pure mosaic here too, in a way i havent known these hops to be in many years, like they have actually been juiced, insanely fresh, and like a concentrated version of themselves, its outrageous in both aroma and flavor, lemon and tangerine and lemongrass and pineapple notes, but also some tea and flowers and botanicals, like nothing else. a million or more beers feature mosaic hops right now, but none like this. just a bit hazier looking than expected, this is pretty thick and even faintly green hued, nice head on it, but not the brightest or sexiest looking ipa. who cares when it smells and tastes like this through, bursting with everything i love about mosaic hops and nothing i dont. i almost think for a second there is some lactose in this, not because its sweet at all, but because there is an insane degree of creaminess to the soft and expansive texture, like satin on the palate, like i want to dive into it. bitterness is really low here, especially for how intense the hops are, its its juicy all the way through the finish. subtle notes of marshmallow, french melon, and kiwi fruit here too. overall just a splendid ipa, they way these should be, and a leader in a very crowded style. this blew me away. dying to try the other beers in this series now!","Aug 01, 2019"

A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a half-finger white head that settles fast.

S: Really nice nose - a strong nose that jumps out of the glass. Dank, green, raw hops and a lot of tropical fruit: mango, some pineapple, papaya. 

T: Follows the nose, with mango, pineapple, citrus pith and peel, and a bite of leafy green hops. White grape skins as I take a few more sips (makes me wonder if Nelson hops are in the house tonight - wait . . . I see that's not the case, must be the Mosaic and Galaxy hops instead. . . ). Alcohol is noted as heat on the back of the palate. Good balance, with a nice bite of bitterness at the end, which lingers.

Upper Case,,Tennessee,4.39/5,"Outstanding beer, and very different. Actually a very similar experience to Big Bird, which I lucked into two years ago as I picked up a flat of Trillium beers in Fort Point on our way to Cape Cod for a bi-annual multi-family trip. I think this one is actually more polished and tasty, fresh, than Big Bird was. But the amazing hop experience is similar. Looks like a muddy pineapple juice, but the aromas and (to a just slightly lesser degree) flavors cover just about every hop-related note I love about hoppy beers. Citrus, pith, berries, mango, musky wine grapes, dank hemp, tropical fruit, wheat biscuit, sugared grapefruit. Absolutely phenomenal. Grassy, but not overly so, which is a nice departure from most NE IPAs. Really nice level of sweetness, as well, and zero green astringency, even fresh, which distances this beer from Big Bird. Feel is a little thin, but that doesn’t take anything away from the amazing, complex, and harmonious nose and tongue. Amazing that you can throw an ungodly amount of different hops together and get such a wonderful end result.","Jul 29, 2019"
Upper Case,,New Jersey,4.38/5,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/31/16 (yes, I know it's old!) with ""HAPPY HALLOWEEN"" written below it. Sure, this beer was quite filling but the flavors, stickiness, and lack of any massive sediment at the bottom of the liquid led me to believe that this was a quality brew, even down to the last sip!

This beer looked like nectar as I poured it out with the waxy, hazy liquid being quite appealing and thicker than anything that I've had from Trillium. Hardly any lacing was left behind as there were just a few spots below a faint thin ring near the top of my pint glass. Lots of mango, papaya, ripe fruit, and tropical hops in the nose as this had quite a heavy aroma, albeit not anything terribly strong. More hops, grape, white wine, faint wood, and hints of a Wild Ale came through in the taste as this was much more complex than I was first led to believe. This malted out for sure but the Pilsner, and Flaked Wheat Malt held on along with some of the Galaxy, as this was not light in body and had little carbonation to keep things lively...

This wasn't light in booze either but it didn't knock me out at all. Nice to see Trillium not brew a beer that I couldn't see through or reminded me of their other offerings. Dry like white wine, I needed a bit of water to get this down when I finished it off...but that's not a knock on this. It was quite a delicious beer that I'd easily get a second time around!","Mar 01, 2019"

Upper Case,,New Hampshire,4.35/5,"Pours an opaque orange gold color with a one finger bone white head that doesn't leave much lacing.

Aroma has tropical notes of orange and grapefruit along with something a little more tart.

Taste is more on the sweet side of the hops with the tropical flavors dominating, mostly in the citrus range. A dry tartness is still present but smartly stays in the background. Malt is lightly present and bitterness is low.

Feel is very soft and smooth, not too effervescent, with a dry alcohol burn in the finish.

This is a pretty damn good DIPA with the soft feel laid on very thick. Flavors are mellow yet very present. Any fan of NEIPAs would be very happy with this one.","Aug 03, 2018"

All the others were amazing too (including Meddle at a close runner up), but this one had more complex flavors and smell. A great NE IPA style, very juicy, and very smooth for the ABV level.

T: Lots of sweet mango and citrus, grass, and a bit of banana and herbs. Finishes with moderate sweetness but still a moderate bitterness, maybe a touch higher than ideal, and a bit muddled on the finish.

Upper Case,,Connecticut,4.66/5,"Had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since I threw a bunch of brews his way for a party. When you open the can, it doesn't just greet you with an aroma, it jumps out and punches you in the face. The flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness. It's hard to describe all the flavors since it's like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion: really fucking loud. I get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin. Mosaic plays the lead role with Galaxy as an obvious supporting job. Serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed, but I never got any booze heat or warmth.

nose loaded with citrus and tropical, dankness, papaya, mango, pineapple, orange tangerine juice, a bit of biscuity toasty wheat and creamy as well

Taste brings that initial typical Trillium flavor profile, citrus, big creamy wheat and malt base, little toasty, plenty of citrus hops, loads of orange juice, mango sorbet, papaya, tangerine, loads of pineapple, lots of pith and a bit of rind, candied orange notes, a touch of alcohol warmth later, fair bitterness throughout that creeps in a bit on the drier but mildly sticky finish.

Smooth,,England,4.3/5,"Slightly hazed golden orange with big bubbles and an insubstantial head, but points earned for good flocculation – no yeasty chunks even though I poured this like an idiot. All the gunk stayed safely compacted at the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is predominantly Band-Aid-ish phenols, some sweet, fresh nectarine, and a delightful apricot kernel/almond note with hints of creamy vanilla to round it out; overall it comes across as a farmyard funked-up peach melba. Tastes much the same, too, but more sour and less funky than anticipated. The 'whole fruit' flavour of the nectarines is amazing, almost like biting into the fresh fruit itself. Quite sour and quite fizzy; a smoother, softer mouthfeel would help carry the fleshy flavour of the fruit better, I think. But overall this is a remarkable fruit beer; the nectarine flavour keeps giving and giving.","Jul 10, 2019"

Smooth,,Illinois,4.56/5,"375ml bottle sealed with silver pressure cap.

poured into Side Project ""sour flute"".

Appearance: opaque orange body with tall white head composed of fine tiny packed bubbles. Bone white head that wisps away fairly quickly, but a thin cap of head remains on the beer during the entire drink. Leaves a bit of lacing on the side of the glass. 

Smell: The nose is bursting with juicy nectarines. This is also oaky, some earthy brett, and light SP funk; but the nose predominantly consists of juicy and authentic fruit. This really does not smell like it is going to be very sour. 

Taste: This is way more sour than the nose would lead you to believe; 7.5 out of 10. Lemon / citrus acidity is huge on the front end of this beer. Light funk, dry oak, and a hint of stone fruit. The fruit does not have the juicy quality that is present in the nose and does not have the intensity as the aroma possesses. The lemony / citrus funk lingers during the entire drink and even on into the finish. Sourness is more intense than the fruit for sure. 

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Bright, citrusy, and dry. A pucker factor big enough that it requires sipping on this beer. Carbonation has a creamy feel to it despite the dry effect that this beer imparts. 

Overall: This sour is hitting on all cylinders. A visually appealing sour. The nose is the best part of this beer because there is so much authentic fruit aroma. A very flavorful sour with an outstanding mouthfeel. I think that the sourness overpowers the fruit a lot in the flavor of the beer and I could use a little bit more nectarine flavor. Not much else need to be improved on here it is just an outstanding fruited american wild ale.","May 25, 2016"
Smooth,,Oregon,4.39/5,"375ml bottle, blend 1. Served in a stemmed glass 4/30/2016.

Pours a medium yellow-orange body, somewhat hazy with a one finger white head. Smells of rich underripe stone fruit, with mild cereal grainy sweetness, oak, and a fair bit of lactic acid. The stonefruit seems to tame down the lactic acid nicely. Flavour is a great balance of stone fruit and lactic acid, which is a bit more restrained than past fruited 375's that have come and gone. Touch of oak, mild funk, cereal grain, peach skin. Mouthfeel is medium-lighter bodied, light and dry on the palate with underripe fruit skin on the finish. A very nice one indeed- remarkably heavy on the fruit, which is a good thing in my book.","May 01, 2016"

Aroma of sour funk (leather) and oak, with a background of tart cherries.

Medium mouth feel, with a touch of syrup. Some drying in the finish but not a tooth scraper.

Montmorency Vs Balaton,,Georgia,3.96/5,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head.
S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.
T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.
M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.
O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.","Sep 03, 2021"

So excited to try this. The be had an Atrial before and it ranked up there as one of my favorite wild ales ever. Upon pouring it, it looks beautiful. Love the color. I’m super disappointed on the nose though. I get a bit of funk and cherrry, but it’s very muted. On the palette though it’s more pronounced. It has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference. I probably like the funk more than most people though. There’s a wonderful balance of sweet and tart with the cherries too. A lovely beer overall. Probably not my top 2-3, but worth the word class ratings.","May 09, 2021"

Montmorency Vs Balaton,,Maine,4.44/5,"Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited. 

500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F. 

Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen. 

Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake. 

Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish. 

Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry. 

Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class.","Apr 06, 2020"

“Bout Six February 2019” on back label. Stored at 42 degrees and served at 45 degrees in a hand-washed and dried Jester King snifter.
Appearance – 4.
First pour – Cerise pink, clear.
Body – Between barn red and maroon, opaque. When held to the light, maroon and translucent.
Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), pink, dense but fizzy, gone nearly concurrent with the end of the pour, leaving a few tiny bubbles as a partial crown, and no cap. Continuous effervescence feeds the crown.
Lacing – None 
Aroma – 4.25 – Cherry.
Flavor – 4.5 - Begins and ends with tart cherries, no hops, no malt, no alcohol (6.1% ABV) flavor or aroma, no dimethylsulfide, no diacetyl. A bit of the tartness may come from the tannic acid from the barrel aging, but the barrel is otherwise not noticed.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium, watery, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation – 4.5 - After missing the first five years of this blend, I’ve finally been able to grab a couple of bottles! And I’m not disappointed!","Aug 23, 2019"
Montmorency Vs Balaton,,Indiana,4.44/5,"Appearance - The beer poured from the bottle a hazy reddish pink color with white bubbles crowning the glass. 

Smell - The nose radiated fresh cherries. It was more tart than sweet, but amazingly fresh. 

Mouthfeel - as with my notes about the smell, the taste was fresh cherries. The leaning was more tart than sweet, but very pleasant. I would compare it to cherry preserves. The overall profile was a little more acidic than I would normally like, but the sweetness provided good balance. The taste was tart all the way through to the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel - Particularly for the style, the beer was very full bodied.

Overall - Some have described this as being like cherry juice. I would suggest the tartness disqualifies that label. The beer really shines when it is served closer to room temperature.","Aug 08, 2019"

Pours a light reddish/purple and pink- color with 1/3"" lighter pink head. The aroma is heavy on the cherry, quite nice. Go Balaton!

Taste, wow, just wow. Feels like they used 3lbs of cherry per gallon or some absurd metric conveying a shit ton of cherries. So much cherry, but there isn't an equally thick viscous cold medicine like feel to it. They draft up a relatively innocuous body for the beer. A lot of beers talk about their pie like qualities but this one pushes cherry pie weight like no other. Any acidity is restrained as can be. Oak is mild, spontaneous funk notes are as well. Easily my favorite Jester King beer, and there have been a few excellent ones along with this one. Good cherry skin and pit dryness complimenting it all the way down.

The bottle is part of a swap with @Artizen, thank you!
The beer pours a pitch black color with minimal dense tan head that foams up only a little bit even after a very aggressive pour. This minimal foam fades away to the thinnest of edge layers quickly after the pour.
Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.
First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.
Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.

Appervation,,Ohio,4.49/5,"12.7 ounce bottle, 2020 vintage, 14.3% ABV. Served in a Jackie O's snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that stayed around for a bit. There's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like oak, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, molasses and dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, with bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, caramel, fudge, oak, molasses, burnt/charred malt, brown sugar and a bit of licorice flavors. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich and a bit sticky with a moderate amount of carbonation. Booze is well hidden here, drinks easily enough for the ABV.

Pours a deep black inky body with a small brown head that reduces quickly, leaving little retention.

Aromas are potent and inviting, bourbon forward. marshmallows and milk chocolate, bourbon fudge brownies, vanilla, caramel, licorice.

On the tongue, caramel and chocolate-vanilla, boozy bourbon soaked dark chocolate brownies, charred oak, roasty dark malt finish that lingers for a bit. Rich body, smooth and velvety. Very easy to drink and smooth for 15%.

Appervation,,Alabama,4.61/5,"2018 Bottle. Opened 06/27/2019.

Dark, viscous pour. As the beer fills the glass, formations of tan head rise and dance on top of the beer, settling into a small ring around the rim of the glass. After a few minutes it dissipates into a flat, black abyss.

Huge amounts of dark fruit and barrel influence to the nose of this beer. To compliment those notes of plum and molasses are solid undertones of bold, dark chocolate and black licorice. Subtleties of oak and vanilla emerge as the beer continues to warm.

Again, the barrel really shines here. A more rugged flavor profile, with smoked oak and leathery tobacco playing at the forefront. Behind it there's a softened, sweeter characteristic, resonating with notes of caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses. Together they balance each other perfectly, with the barrel influence preventing too much of a cloying sweetness on the palate. After letting your taste buds settle for a moment, there's a very present nuttiness to this beer as well, a roasty quality that further adds to the complexity of this beer.

Viscous, soft, and sticky. A full-bodied mouthfeel, with a very soft yet still noticeable carbonation that clings desperately to a boozy warmth that catches you in the finish.

2020 Bottle. Opened 11/25/2021.

A barrel showcase, and a very under-appreciated beer in my opinion. Smoke and licorice on the nose, with the palate boasting loads of bourbon and heat. Finish is a tad abrasive, and it could use some more weight, but always an enjoyable sipper.","Jun 27, 2019"
Appervation,,Minnesota,4.12/5,"Thanks to a local for swapping fluids with me & knocking a long, long time want off my list. 375ML classic Jackie O’s bottle while watching Merle die & celebrating another Twins win. 

Inky black with no rise even given a hard pour. The nose is barrel & a sweetness that leans hard into molasses & chocolate. The unholy trinity. 

Appervation could be presented as a Black Tuesday variation & I wouldn’t bat an eye. The mouthfeel is decadent AF, as the kids say, thicker than grandma’s fudge batter & almost as appealing. Bourbon booms out of the glass, along with most of the malts harvested in 2017. Sweet, dripping sweet, oak, maple, fudge, black silk, black licorice. No booziness present except when I stood up to go relieve myself. Bed is two flights of stairs away. 

Not quite sure what the hype was about. Jackie O’s makes better BA stouts, but I understand that having Derivation in, or rumored to be in, its DNA brings out the hype beast. Still an excellent BA stout.","May 11, 2019"
Appervation,,New Jersey,4.21/5,"A: Thick black pour with elusive mocha-brown highlights, and a head with minimal characteristics: formation, retention, lacing

S: Molasses, liquorice, bourbon-drenched dark fruit concentrations with a vinous touch: An aroma of depth given the array of milk chocolate, oaked nutty malts, cocoa powder, caramel swirl, burned char, leather, subdued coconut 

T: Lots of minute workings to become deep-rooted in: the silky sharp chocolate, tricky layers of dark fruit, smoky tobacco, rich caramel, singed toffee, roasted walnuts, baked vanilla espresso, a touch of maple fudge

M: Moderately sticky and semi cloying with distant carbonation. It’s fairly roast-y and sweet with a delicate peppery kick

O: A well balanced and blended vintage that aged with poise spitting out more prunes, raisins, dates, and figs as it progressed with a bit of tannin spiced/peppery herbs, ashtray/charred wood, and hints of brownie stuffed graham crackers. Aroma from the empty bottle was pure maple syrup with tracings of prunes, figs, and tannin foregrounds before fading into the ether","Feb 26, 2019"

Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, fig, date, smoke, char, leather, tobacco, pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness. Very mild herbal/roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak tannin spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, nuts, dark bread, coconut, licorice, dark fruit, light smoke/char/pepper, and roast/toast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; with a solid roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is amazing. Mildly increasing warmth of 13.5%, with no barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged imperial stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV; with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying finish. Insanely rich malt complexity, with perfect barrel integration/balance. Not overly roasty/charred on malts, or boozy/tannic on barrels.

Foggier Window,,Connecticut,4.27/5,"Canned on 7/19/22; consumed on 8/17/22

Pours a turbid, milky honey-gold body topped with three fingers of fluffy, whote foam; good head retention yields ¾ of a finger of creamy cap, a thin, frothy collar, and slight, webby layers of taut, soapy lacing lining the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings fresh orange zest contrasting a musty lime undertone, with prickly resins and underripe mango building to candied grapefruit as peach fades atop a boggy subtext.

Taste offers ripe, waxy white grape sporting a tinge of honey upfront as notes of papaya and musty agave graze the mid-palate; subtle moss enlivened by orange zest on the back end culminates with fleshy peach trending into jackfruit density on the closing impressions.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body and moderate carbonation dispersing a taut prickle into an otherwise creamy mid-palate, where resinous grit lingers to a silky back end and balanced finish sporting a subdued bitterness.

Hearty resins amplify fresh, dank overtones to a waxy, tropical potpourri; an exceedingly stimulating profile balanced with silky, bittering edges.","Aug 17, 2022"

Pours a hazy pale gold color with a 2 finger creamy white head that has stubborn retention and leaves a halo of lacing around the glass when the stupid head finally starts to dissipate.

The aroma starts off citrusy, with loads of grapefruit, tangerine, and lemon zest. Then comes a wave of pineapple, melon, papaya, overripe mango, blueberry and strawberry. Very grainy as well. 

The flavor has a ton of pineapple, as well as grapefruit, orange creamsicle, tangerine and melon. There's a bit of papaya, mango, guava and mixed berries with a rindy finish. Very grainy, like the nose. So much going on here.

Medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Fluffy, creamy and pillowy soft. No alcohol presence.

S: pithy citrus w/ floral undertone... delicate musky tone slowly creeps out, even a bit of honeyed cereal grain... nice (maybe too) subdued yet layered array of aromas... herbal and marginally earthy-minty tone emerges to the fore

T: floral static, subtly gin-like herbal melange... notably dry aftertaste with a soft doughy note lingering on the sides of the palate in the cheeks... vague bubblegum hum after a few sips, obscured within the (again, dry) tropical candy powder fog... the alcohol is apparent, buried in the background, certainly affecting a burst in expressiveness about 1/3 through the volume... the booze-bitter interplay shapes a herbal accent over say capsicum heat or spicy spice... a pool of static; latent grapefruit milk

F: fortified, attenuated nectar; a sheet of resins and oils, lifted... quietly luscious and seductive

O: hmm... an ascent to the stars... a standout among the relatively few NEIPAs I've tasted... this is more to my flavor preferences, as in like a NEIPA-WCIPA-kellerbier hybrid(?)... The first of I hope several ventures into the world of Other Half (1822)","Sep 12, 2021"

Ground State,,Wisconsin,3.8/5,"2018 draft from the tap room. I've had a lot of great coffee beers and it's one of my favorite adjuncts, but this was almost straight coffee for me with little barrel, enough to the point that I did not feel it was worth drinking this over coffee. Just my opinion, but I know a lot of others feel differently - just check the rating and previous reviews. Love Bottle Logic, but just wasn't feeling this beer.","Mar 22, 2019"
Ground State,,Ohio,4.59/5,"2018 edition courtesy of Lingenbrau

Pour is black, somewhat viscous, moderate tan head. 

Smells like bourbon soaked cocoa nibs with oak and vanilla. A touch boozy. Some maple syrup/caramized sugars and burnt coffee grounds in the background. 

Maple flavor strikes first. Not overpowering, but prominent. The bourbon follows with oak, vanilla, and corn mash, rounded out by rich milk chocolate and a subtle roasted coffee. 

Every one of their beers I have had has been in the Bourbon County, Firestone Walker category as far as body goes. This one is a touch thinner, but still exceptionally full and luscious without being syrupy (especially with syrup) or cloying. Just a touch of lip smacking stickiness. 

It definitely shows some of the ABV both in aroma and taste, especially if you were to compare to a Bourbon County varient that is stronger, but a phenomenal beer that pretty much lives up to the label.","Dec 25, 2018"
Ground State,,Massachusetts,4.15/5,"Received in a trade and shared with JLindros. 2017 edition.

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave light wisps.

S - Aromas of heavy maple syrup, cocoa, bourbon barrel. No discernable alcohol.

T -Taste is similar to the nose with loads of maple sweetness and good vanilla and light chocolate. Good cocoa and sugars. Pleasant.

M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, crisp, bright. Could be better and fluffy.

Ground State,,Pennsylvania,4.23/5,"2018 bottle. Teku pour. Preface that I generally prefer BA stouts without coffee.

L - Fizzy, translucent black with thick bubbly head. Looks very highly carb'd.

S - Tastey aroma but hardly differentiated from a founders breakfast stout. There is a little more sweetness which I'm getting maple from (but is that the power of suggestion?). Wasnt blown away by CBS but to memory I liked its aroma more. Note that I'm also getting cinnamon as it warms.

T - Oh damn that's sweet. Coffee is more muted than most which I appreciate. The maple syrup is tough to find, but it's there (somewhere. I think?). The roast level is dark in the coffee and the malts. The bitterness found is medium to high and begins to develop as it warms. Overall very rich in flavor.

F - Very highly carb'd. I would not define it as ""thick"" regardless of its sweetness and sugars. Feel is status quo and not necessarily anything noteworthy.

O - Solid beer. Top 250 beer that trades for $75? Lol. This is a hype beer and why I think I'm giving up trading, at least for ""limited"" beers. It is a good beer, and I'd be happy to buy it once or twice at cost if I were local. But for California to hype bottle logic to their ""value"" or Florida to hype JWB or AC, or my local brethren here in PA to hype Voodoo to the tradde ""value"" that they soar to makes me just want to laugh. If you're into paying for the name on things then the aforementioned breweries (and MANY more) are what you're looking for. I'm more than over seeking out these super limited beers. I'll drink the few others I have in my cellar and stick to the equally tastey shelf beers.","Nov 25, 2018"
Ground State,,Minnesota,4.71/5,"This was a gifted bottle from a BIF buddy - and one that I was very, very excited about. I shared this with friends at a local brewery, thus my pour was small, but the beer is undeniably impressive - the nose is full of maple and coffee notes. The beer tastes of light coffee roast, just a bit acidic from the coffee, with plenty of pleasant maple syrup and cacao. It is baffling to me that this is so much harder to get than Fundamental Observation - but as good as it is, it perhaps should not surprise. Who wants to trade away such a fantastic beer?","Nov 04, 2018"
Ground State,,New York,4.8/5,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small mocha colored head, and not much lacing.

This smells incredible- just a big chocolatey espresso bomb, with light earthy maple syrup, high quality dark chocolate, toasted oak, heavy dark roast, cookie dough, bourbon, and brown guar.

This is absolutely excellent, and one of the best uses of coffee I've ever had in a beer. The coffee is so fresh and vibrant, with a perfect roast level, some cookie dough and brown sugar flavors, and lots of chocolate. The beer is just so fudgy and smooth. The barrel is light, more oaky than actual bourbon. The maple is definitely a subtle touch- it is very far from a true maple bomb. 

This is thick and chewy, and very creamy, with miraculously still a very drinkable feel to it.

This is possibly the best beer I've had from Bottle Logic so far. This is absolutely wonderful.","Aug 30, 2018"
Ground State,,Massachusetts,4.27/5,"First beer from Bottle Logic. Pours a thick viscous deep brown/blackish color. Nice mocha head that fades after a minute or so. Glass lacing is there, as it should for a high ABV stout. Smell is sweet bourbon and dark roast coffee. Some vanilla, too, but definitely a bourbon presence. Taste is very bourbon forward, especially before it warms. It’s to the point even after it warms it’s a somewhat hot from the bourbon. I’m not getting much maple, but am getting lots of dark roast coffee. Also dark chocolate, so that aspect of the beer definitely shows. Some more faint vanilla and even a little dark fruit. Got a hint of caramel sweetness, too. Feel is right there with other bourbon beers. Overall, it’s good but I think it needs a year to mature. If I’m not getting much maple now, I don’t expect more to come forward. I’d rather see where this goes after some time in the cellar.","Aug 25, 2018"
Ground State,,Illinois,4.64/5,"2018 vintage. Bottle poured into snifter.

Pours black with a half inch medium brown head.

Nose: vanilla and coffee dominate. Bourbon barrel and maple come in towards the end. Bourbon is pretty subtle.

Taste: phenomenal. Follows the nose mostly - coffee and chocolate lead followed closely by maple. Vanilla starts to take over as it warms, and towards the end it’s really dominated by vanilla and maple. Bourbon barrel is fairly subtle and drifts in and out. Finishes semi sweet with more maple and vanilla.

Feel: full-bodied, smooth, medium-low carbonation.","Jul 03, 2018"
Ground State,,California,4.25/5,"Batch 3 (2018), poured into an Alesmith snifter. Pours a medium dark espresso. Nose is mostly maple, coffee, and oak, with some butterscotch and caramel. Palate is chocolate fudge, maple, coffee, with oak and butterscotch notes. Disappointingly, the chocolate and maple dominates the barrel character, so it’s not as complex as one might hope. Still a good brew, but it's not in the upper tier of the category.","Jul 02, 2018"
Ground State,,Virginia,4.45/5,"2018 release.

A: Pours black with a half finger of cola-like dark brown head. Average retention and almost no lacing.

S: Strong coffee, light cocoa and vanilla bean, and mild rounded bourbon.

T: Rich and strong coffee dominate the flavor, alongside a light but very well integrated sweetness, dry oak, and bourbon. Mild roastiness and mouthcoating coffee through a long finish.

M: Medium-full body, chewy, with medium-light but cutting carbonation.

O: Bottle Logic proves again its deftness with its barrel program. Coffee dominates, but the base and barrel provide nice (though admittedly light) accents. The only knock on this is that it might be considered a bit one-dimensional, and I’m not getting any maple flavor.","Jun 21, 2018"

Aroma burst forth with boozy bourbon barrel, bittersweet cocoa, and sweet maple. Hint of vanilla pushes through as it warms.

Flavor is full of maple, smooth bourbon, flash of sweet vanilla followed by bitter baking cocoa. Booze isn’t hot, but you can tell it comes in pretty high on the ABV scale.

Orviamo,,Oregon,4.53/5,"750ml bottle. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass.

Pours a dark reddish-brown body, one finger white head, good retention, not much lacing or film. Smells of jammy raspberry and a touch of stonefruit, a bit of funk, a bit of dark fruit and a bit of oak. This is the stuff of dreams. Big fruit presence with a complex barrel presence- that's what an AWA is supposed to be, right? Flavour is very similar; tons of jammy raspberry. Some stone fruited plum. Bright vibrant fruit sweetness intermingles in with dark fruit and the parent spirits. A bit of warming heat on the end, not unlike whiskey served neat. Mild fruity funk, but overall the fruit is the star of the show. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, soft and perfectly carbonated, and you get very little hint of the 10% ABV aside from the warming feeling as it goes down. Superb, very complex. Overall, another wonderful, heavy fruit jammed acetic wild from two of the best brewers in the US doing this type of wild ale. It's quite balanced! Nowhere near as sour as everyone has made it out to be, even more fruit than expected, and that's saying a lot.","May 07, 2016"
Orviamo,,Illinois,4.07/5,"750ml bottle, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Generously shared by Erik, enjoyed on 1.16.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.

The beer pours a deep maroon color, hues of burgundy and crimson, hazy and cloudy with a bone colored head, about a finger high that has good retention and lace. The aroma is very intense and very complex, all of the barrels are immediately present. Very fruity, loads of raspberry, prunes and very cherry forward, strong port wine, tannic, acidic, vinous, very rich, very deep with soft oak, a bit of vinegar and some potent booze character. The flavors offer a bit more in terms of balance and lets each element breathe. Still, the various barrels are front and center, loads of port wine, vinous red wine and rich and oaky bourbon with a fantastic helping of raspberry and plum, more plum than the nose suggested, delicate and tart with some light vinegar and some warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is nice, coating, lively, almost juicy at times with a medium body and a crisp finish.

Verdict: A very intense Wild Ale from Side Project and De Garde, perhaps too much at once. Rich, complex with great depth, but at times, the balance is lacking and the 10% ABV is very apparent.","Jan 18, 2016"
Orviamo,,District of Columbia,4.82/5,"Hands down the best Side Project beer I've had and a standout at a bottle share with many other top notch beers. Refreshing, fruity and well balanced on the sour end. Some SP's veer into the overly acidic range, but this is nicely restrained.","Oct 09, 2015"
Orviamo,,Florida,3.52/5,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Murky deep red body. Medium khaki head. Heavy raspberry and some dark fruits. Red wine. Alcohol. Intense.

Orviamo,,Florida,4.86/5,"Deepest red hue. With an eggshell white head. The aroma is plum, port, and wine. A hint of whiskey as it warms. The woody aspects are clean. Taste follows the nose with a jammy berry note as well. The body is light/medium. No hint of 10% abv. This feels like it should be listed as 5->7% Awesome.","Sep 07, 2015"
Orviamo,,California,4.61/5,"Among the best beers I've had from Side Project. Mauve / garnet hued with an ivory, pink tinged head that fades to a ring of lazy bubbles. Tons of funk, green apple, pear, oak, and of course raspberry, goat cheese, citrus, and subtle vinegar in aroma and flavor. Acidity is bracing but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is creamy. I always appreciate when fruit and base come together in harmony rather than fruit taking such an obvious lead. This is a great example of that.","Aug 21, 2015"
Orviamo,,Indiana,5/5,"A- Pours a hazy and deep amber in color with plenty of pink and red coming through. A good sized, fizzy, and dense head forms and calms down to about a centimeter in thickness. The remaining head hangs around a good while and laces very well as well.

S- Bright and slightly tart raspberries and base beer funk hit the nose right up front. Some sweetness kicks in at the back end of the smell, probably form the plums. Hints of the sweet port also kick in towards the end and preside over the light funk that lies underneath. Really a delicious smell.

T- Starts with a big bang of raspberries and tartness right off the bat. The fruit is fresh and jammy and very raspberry forward. Hints of the plums kick in next along with some sweeter port notes. At the back end of the drink, a touch of musty funk and whiskey barrel dryness kicks in. The barrel gives some spice to the flavor and the base beer provides a touch of grain flavor. The whiskey barrel flavor is definitely least prominent of the barrel flavors, but all 3 add some complexity to the beer's flavor.

M- When this beer hit;s the tongue, it is an odd combination of slick, smooth, and thick with a good dose of carbonation. It is a very unique feel on the palate, but it fits the beer's flavors profile very well. There is a touch of alcohol warmth and astringent burnt on the way down, but it is well within expectations for a 10% ABV, fruited, wild ale.

Overall, this may be my favorite brew of Cory's so far. It blends his brewing strengths of fruit, barrels, and wild yeast seamlessly and subtly, representing all of the flavors the label promises. My favorite part is that it is both sour and high in ABV without being overpowering in either aspect. I highly recommend trying this now, as it will not get any more fruit forward in the future.","Aug 08, 2015"
Orviamo,,New Jersey,4.56/5,"Pours a deep ruby hued brown, with a medium sized head of tight off white bubbles that leave excellent lacing.

Smell: Gorgeous, very very jammy. More raspberry than plum in the nose at least. Slight vinegar. Smells a bit like an NG fruit, perhaps Strawberry rhubarb.

Taste: Very sour, hints of port. Still gets lots of strawberry from this, maybe some sweet sugar plums, hints of vinegar, raspberry.

Mouthfeel: Pretty aggressive sour, jammy but dry. High level of carb.

Pours a relatively clear light plum skin color with hues of maroon, rust, and garnet, and topped by a foamy, sticky, slightly off-white head. Initially there is little sediment, but towards the bottom the beer pours milky with flecks suspended in a surprisingly viscous liquid. The nose is funk and raspberries, some esters, a little whiskey caramel and oak off the barrel, minimal booze, and no butter. The taste favors the plum initially, but more tart raspberry and funk creep in towards the finish. I'm really curious about what will happen to the balance when the bugs take over. It's medium bodied, modestly carbonated, and has a rich barrel and grain sweetness that's cut by tart stone fruit, ethanol, and wood. This is a very solid offering that gets both the raspberry and plum spot on, yet still brings the funk - one of my favorite side project beers/collabs to date.","May 30, 2015"
Orviamo,,Colorado,5/5,"IMHO, its the best SP beer produced, after drinking this drinking anything else might be a let down emotionally. I wish they made more so that everyone could experience this work of art. Really makes me interested in trying more DeGarde products too.","May 28, 2015"
Orviamo,,Illinois,4.73/5,"750ml bottle poured into 2 wine stems at SP cellar. (On-site consumption bottle)

Appearance: Deep purple with 2 full fingers of white head. Heavy lacing on the glass. Head drops down to a thin cap during entire time drinking this beer. 

Smell: Jammy raspberries and hint of plums. The fruit in this beer honestly smells like a DeGarde Imperial Bu. This is very fruit forward wild ale and has pretty hefty funk as well. Lacto presence is also well established in the aroma. This smells outstanding.

Taste: It is very raspberry forward in the beginning and it is all plums in the finish. Raspberry flavor is jammy and has a sweet and tart quality about it. The plums are juicy and sweet. Both fruits are very authentic in the flavor profile. Tartness is a 4/10 and builds in the finish. You can tell that this has a barrel presence, but it is not easy to discern the three different barrels used to age this beer. Light barnyard and nice lacto notes as well. Very complex, very delicious, very balanced.

Mouthfeel: On the light end of a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Creamy carbonation with a light dryness in the finish. This beer is absurdly drinkable. It drinks like a 5% abv wild ale. I cant believe this beer is 10%abv. The blending is outstanding on this beer and gives a premium mouthfeel rivaling many of the premium fruited sour of belgium. Perhaps even over achieving what most Belgian styles have for mouthfeel.

Overall: This is the best SP beer that I have drank to date. There is some serious wow factor to this beer. The cost was $40 dollars for this bottle of beer; I would gladly spend another 40 bucks to taste it again. Side projects is killing it.","May 28, 2015"

Canuckley,,Massachusetts,4.34/5,"2022 vintage

I picked this one up on a whim on Tavour just because I’m a sucker for maple syrup in a Stout, but little did I know that this is a highly acclaimed take on the style. I’ve heard good things about Transient bu haven’t has them until now. Let’s pop thid guy open see what it’s all about

Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of dense dark tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The maple honestly isn’t even the first thing that jumps out at me in the nose, opting for a thinner maple profile to support the other adjuncts. I’m picming up on aromas of dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, milk chocolate, maple sap, burnt caramel, molasses, charred oak, and light vanilla

It’s also not extremely maple in taste, but it is unfortunately a bit sweeter than the nose led me to believe. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting burnt caramel, dark roast coffee, black cherry, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, toasted oak, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, black cherry, raisin, vanilla, toasted oak, and sweet bourbon

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick beer. Finishes a tad sticky but drinks remarkably below its abv

While it is quite sweet, it’s damn good and way too easy to drink for being 14.5%","Jun 27, 2023"

Canuckley,,Texas,4.9/5,"#131, yummy!","Jul 29, 2022"
Canuckley,,New Jersey,4.25/5,"A: Asphalt highlights to an obsidian pour that’s oily in circumference. The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes

S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs 

T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire

M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations

O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces","Jun 28, 2022"
Canuckley,,Michigan,4.43/5,"Brief Review:

O: Highly rated beer here from Transient, from my home state. Just got through Kentuckely, which I thought was just okay. Surprised to see such high ratings for this beer. Kind of a competitor to CBS, but with extra maple syrup and vanilla added. Gets a little muddled because of that for me. Little boozy and hot as well. It's a decent beer, I just wouldn't say it's that well balanced.

Recommendation: One of the better Transient beers I've had, but maybe not world class just yet.","Jun 06, 2022"

It looks black. It smells good. I love syrup. 

Canuckley walks that sweet, bourbon tightrope without ending up all Karl Wallenda. Maple syrup is prominent, dare I say pre-eminent, taste flailing around the palate. Mild bourbon that gets into the sinuses, sweet malts, chocolate, with a soft echo of cocoa mocha & a finish of Peter Murphy (1989). Appropriately thick (a la 2016). I could drink this out of flagons. 

Really a lovely upgrade to a solid base of Buckley. Excellent beer.","Nov 19, 2021"
Canuckley,,Illinois,4.54/5,"This bottle was my choice for my 3600 rating on beer advocate! Been wanting to try this for a long time. So here we go!

500ml bottle poured into Deep Woods snifter. 

Vintage 2021

Appearance: dark as the black of night. One or two fingers thick of medium brown head that drops down to thin ring around the perimeter of the glass. This pours menacingly thick. Significant booze legs.

Smell: you can smell the bourbon from those Blis barrels with robust dark roast coffee & hints of vanilla and maple.

Taste: starts off with bakers cocoa / fudgy chocolate blending in some earthy maple syrup and rich bourbon notes that adds so much sweetness & richness to the beer. Authentic vanilla bean notes seems to flood in during the middle & becomes the dominate flavor. Then the beer transitions to a dark & earthy roast coffee that adds a lightly burnt and firmly bitter finish. All adjuncts accounted for and all taste authentic. This definitely tastes like tugboat coffee, if you’ve had towboat coffee in a stout you know exactly what I’m talking about.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied stout. Low yet adequate carbonation levels. Thick and smooth at fridge temperature. As it warms this beer thins out and gets a little boozy. It is an appropriate amount of booziness for the almost 15% ABV this beer clocks in at. This beer is sticky sweet and is well balanced with rich barrel notes and robust coffee.

Overall: Cantuckley a really great stout brewed by Transient. I think I prefer Kentuckley over Cantuckley... though... it’s by a fairly small margin. This didn’t disappoint; it’s exactly what the Brewer set out to do based on the description of the beer on the label. The sum of all the parts work so well together that it becomes something really great. Looking forward to Buckley Reserve blends 1 & 2 that I have stashed away for a special occasion.","Aug 20, 2021"
Canuckley,,Indiana,4.6/5,"Pours a beautiful onyx black with a slightly fizzy and sudsy dark tan head that is a slightly fleeting participant in this beer. The nose is heavy on the barrel up front, with a significant boozy aroma, but as it warms, the coffee and vanilla emerge, and the maple from the barrel releases as well, and there’s a decadent milk chocolate note as well. Other than that, not much going on here.

I let this warm a while before I tasted it and I’m glad I did, because the taste has that rich maple flavor up front along with the milk chocolate and coffee, with the booziness from the barrel and the vanilla at the very back of the palate, for a warming finish. Wow cubed.

The mouthfeel is rich and creamy, more than substantial enough to hold this sledgehammer of a beer up and keep it on point all the way through the 500 ML bottle. 

I’m guessing this is Transient’s offering to compete with CBS. It does so exceptionally well. World class stuff, IMHO.","May 30, 2021"
Canuckley,,Michigan,4.64/5,"Pour a 500ml bottle into a North Coast Brewing tulip glass; opaque black with thin, tan head. Smell of vanilla, sweet something boozy. Taste coffee, vanilla, maple trees; wow, yum. Rich mouthfeel. Tremendous.","Mar 19, 2021"

Canuckley,,New York,4.38/5,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

There's a lot of maple to this one on the nose, to no one's surprise. It's a dark, earthy, and sweet maple character, and it doesn't get too cloying for me. I also get bitter roast, oak, and lots of coffee.

I definitely like this one better than Buckley, and I think I also like it more than Kentuckley. The barrel character is great, adding some char and oak to a big maple blast. The coffee plays well with it, adding roast, some light dried fruit, and some smoke.

This is medium bodied, creamy, and slightly boozy, but not as boozy as 14.5% would usually indicate.

I don't really like regular Buckley all that much, but all of the BA versions I've had have been much better.","Oct 15, 2020"

The first sip I knew it was perfect and by the end I knew I had one of the best beers I had ever had. I hadn’t been that blown away from a BBA beer since I had vanilla bean Dark Lord on tap in like 2009 at Dark Lord Day, before it was called Marshmallow Handjee.

Taste - Super smooth velvet really coats your mouth thick to the point of being chewy. Nice dry finish little heat from the booze.

T: Fairly sweet and dessert-like but nice balance of rich maple syrup, mild dark roast, dark coffee, vanilla bean, and round-ish bourbon and oak. Finishes with a long, moderately sweetness that’s offset by a hefty tannic roast.

M: Medium-full body, medium carbonation, moderate alcohol warmth, slight stickiness.

Insane complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, vanilla, coffee, maple syrup, maple barrels, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; with a solid roast/hop bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness; and no cloying sweetness after the finish. Slightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and super full body; with a very smooth, creamy, silky, velvety, rich mouthfeel that is perfect. Slight slickness, sticky hops, chalky roast, and bourbon/oak tannins.

All around amazing complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, vanilla, coffee, maple syrup, maple barrels, and light earthy hop/fruity yeast flavors; dangerously smooth and easy to drink for the huge ABV, with the very mildly bitter/tannic/drying; perfectly soft/silky feel. Perfectly balanced super rich malts, vanilla, fruity/nutty coffee, maple syrup, and maple barrel presence/integration; with mild earthy hops. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness.

Aroma is rich roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with big swells and waves of caramel, toffee, molasses, chocolate, and coffee. Coffee is mild, but integrated well. Bourbon hits right at the finish, notching the heat up right at the end, but not enough to push it into boozy or burning territory. Flavor profile is big roasty, toasty, and caramely malts with decadent layers of toffee, chocolate, and coffee throughout. Despite leaning into the darkness, it has playful hits of sweetness. Bourbon and char add a swell of bitterness and heat at the end, but not enough to upend the balance. Mouth feel is thick. It's full, creamy, and hearty. It's viscosity suggests a much higher alcohol percentage. Overall, a hefty, hearty stout enhanced by coffee and bourbon.

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,,Germany,4.2/5,"2018 vintage, opened in 2021

Pours an oily midnight black with no head to speak of, but a lasting spider web lacing atop the liquid.

Smells of melting chocolate among toasty malts and smoky rye, together with a floral sweet, rich whipped cream impression.

Has a creamy, smooth mouthfeel, showcasing a rich and full bodied beer, together with a lower, well fitting carbonation.

Tastes of bourbon soaked, toasty coffee beans, additional char among whipped cream and lighter molasses. Has a short, sugary peak, coated up by even more whipped cream, warming spices and light coconut flakes among a flowery softness. Finishes with bitter chocolate, a pleasant currant tartness, lighter hazelnuts and a long lasting bourbon dryness, together with honey and maple syrup.

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,,Minnesota,4.35/5,"The last bottle from a beautiful trade with That_Bearded_Guy this summer, which I was saving to pop on our twentieth wedding anniversary. Split with my marvelous wife!

The 750ML bottle has one of those handy tags that rips a hole in the wax big enough to get a bottle opener in, which my oft-punctured fingers appreciate. Silver wax sprays off & we’re into a big, black beer with minimal visible carbonation. The nose is Willy Wonka bar, coffee, & light, warm malts. Nice. 

Sump – Barrel Aged Coffee Stout is an odd breed of coffee stout. The coffee shows as roast in the nose & only faintly in the taste, which leans into herbs & dark fruit. Slotting in next is plenty of cocoa, char, lovely shot of whiskey, vanilla creamer, & what tastes like good old Wesley’s Maple Syrup. The Finnish is all NIN bass, dark, driving, tasty. Old school big stout thick (not pastry chef thick), which raises the drinkability level. 

This is a beer that is in no way, no form, no how worth the price of admission. It’s Sump plus a bit of char & whiskey. Still: Sump = Excellent, & the BA version continues that trend of excellence. Happy to have it in my mouth.","Sep 17, 2019"

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,,Ohio,4.4/5,"Tar black with a dark mocha fizz that disappears quickly leaving a slick, taut black surface.

The aroma is super creamy and fudgey dark chocolate brownie with vanilla bean and mocha, while a fine bourbon oak is smoothly present, yet not overpowering.

Amazing flavors of deep dark chocolate brownie somehow don't come across as too sweet, as rich vanilla accents a very nicely complex charred oak that's simultaneously woody, herbal and spicy. Cocoa dusted prune comes out in the swallow as follow-up sip enhances the dark coffee and measured bourbon presence.

The medium body is slick with a finely crisp but quick to die fizz that finishes semi-dry, tingly, and a little sticky.

This is certainly deserving of the hype--the rare instance of bourbon barrel aging that creates a massive improvement over its base.

Feel is viscous and think for an IIPA, but has very good carb. Overall, this smells incredible and initial good taste, but the hop burn overtakes the palate. Maybe the hops need to dye down some - but this can is around a month old at this point. Have two other cans, and will open in increments over the next month. Will update if the taste increase.","May 09, 2020"

Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Indiana,4.46/5,"Pouring from a 16 oz. can into a Trillium Willi Becher style glass, this beer pours out like a cross between mango and orange juice. Forms a thin crown that dissipates to only an outer ring, attached to the glass. 

The nose brings a beautiful citrus mixing with a very natural, sweet honey. Wow. The way the two mix are amazing. Mango, orange, peach, honey and caramel all backed by a dank background. 

The taste comes in with those dank, pronounced layers of citrus tangling through sweet layers of honey and caramel; slight bubblegum wants to come out but never does with much pronunciation, just as an accent. There are some floral notes, but not too pronounced. 

Fairly clean with little to no sharpness; slight bitterness but overall smooth and creamy on the mouthfeel. 

Overall, I love the way the honey and layers of sweetness interact with the pungent, citrus, earthy hops. It’s a smooth, enjoyable brew.","May 15, 2019"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Oregon,4.44/5,"16oz can, breaking in the new Trillium snifter. Bright hazy golden yellow body, one finger frothy and thick latte white head, plenty of retention, lots of lacing. Looks positively appetizing. Smell is massive Galaxy aromatics- tropical fruit, grapefruit, mild herbal spice, floral notes, mild caramel. The honey isn't really present here on the nose, but on the palate, it's there in spades at the end and finish, for sure. It's a wonderful mild honey sweetness that lingers for a while. Mild-moderate spicy bitterness, otherwise big but relatively balanced galaxy and caramel malt. This is pretty delicious, and the honeyed finish is really, really very nice. Medium fuller bodied, good carbonation, silky smooth with a slight dry floral and herbal resin that is supplanted by a mild lingering sweet honey.","May 11, 2019"

Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Connecticut,3.21/5,"Canned on 10/11/18

Pours opaque, glossy honey gold with about a finger of pillowy, white foam that recedes pretty quickly in favor of thin layers of sticky lacing.

Aromas of raw honey meld with dank hops for an absolutely pungent bouquet forming notes of herbaceously sweet sugar cane and lighter notes of rubber; powerful stuff, and definitely an aroma I’m finding personally polarizing.

Taste brings plenty of herbal hops to start, building slowly in honeyed sweetness and saturating further tones of hops, pine, grapefruit zest, and mango to an effect similar to the aroma.

Mouthfeel has a medium body with well-balanced carbonation, and actually reveals a certain level of prickly hops to the finish; little to no bitterness, and surprisingly trending toward light on the palate.

Maybe the most polarizing NEIPA I’ve tried to date; I tend to like IPAs on the pungent side, but the honey really brings this to a new level, one that is equal parts confidently herbaceous and dramatically too dank.","Nov 06, 2018"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Maine,4.48/5,"One of the rare reviews I'll do, NOT from stream-of-consciousness, but rather from notes I wrote down. I drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago, in silence, save for the rushing river next to me. An experience.

A world of thanks to Jon for this can.

Pint can dated 10/11/18 - poured into a tulip at about 45 degrees.

Pours an unbelievable glowing neon orange juice color. Completely opaque. Creamy, milky, turbid, murky, all of it. Haze for dayz. Almost literally glows in the dark. 

Nose has an undeniable dankness to it, and some exotic floral notes I cannot place. Creamy and musty with round, yeasty notes. Very unique hopping. Overall, the nose is mellow, but what it has going on is unique. Truly smells like a hop galaxy, if that makes any sense. I know it doesn't.

Palate is earthy eucalyptus, lavendar, manuka honey notes, vanilla, and some exotic floral accents, that I have not experienced before. Moderate to decent sweetness in the middle, and finishes with ZERO bitterness. Some Douglas fir (piney lemon) dryness, but absolutely no bitterness. Finishes floral, pine, eucalyptus, and yeast notes. Vanilla lingers extremely long into the finish. Getting what I can only describe as a birthday cake note. Cake batter. Flavor profile is very round, full, floral, earthy, and impressions of sweet things without the sweetness. 

Mouthfeel on this is truly divine, and even goes toe to toe with Julius. Luscious, pillowy, soft, round, full. The word in a nutshell is fluffy. This is a fluffy beer. Excellent carbonation gives it a touch of lift, but doesn't sharpen it. World class feel. Amazing.

Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. A truly delicious and pleasing beer. Satisfying. Exotic hops give unique floral impressions that I haven't experienced before. Must be unique to Galaxy. Restrained, balanced, and soft spoken. It doesn't come out and demand you acknowledge it's presence. It remains quiet, mysterious, and alluring, and waits for you to come to it, recognizing its greatness on your own. I enjoyed every last drop of this beer, and will seek it out again at all costs. You should too, because it is a fantastic beer, with a fantastic feel, and some very unique character and nuance. Special.","Nov 04, 2018"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Minnesota,4.6/5,"Galaxy is not one of my favorite hops - I'll be honest and just throw that out there.

That being said, there are things about galaxy that I do like quite a lot. When combined with other hops, it tends to be a smorgasbord of sweet, clean, rich haze. Cutting Tiles delivers in spades - it's almost too sweet, but it doesn't quite cross that border in to syrupy, which is good - I cannot abide that in an IPA. The beer is still plenty drinkable and doesn't have that filling quality that I hate. The bubble gum/cotton candy tasty that many attribute to galaxy is not all that forward - it's there, but not offensive or overwhelming.

I'd generally prefer a Fort Point - but this specific variant of Cutting Tiles is quite good.","Nov 04, 2018"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Florida,4.78/5,"This beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which I’ll admit I’m a galaxy fanboy. This is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better. Perfect execution. The only tweak I would make to make it my number 1 beer ever (beats is infinite by monkish, a DDH All galaxy imperial IPA) would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level.

Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Massachusetts,4.71/5,"One of the best IPAs I’ve had. Would put this just below Perm 32 for me. I remember having Mosaic Cutting Tiles last year, and thought it was a mess. The new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop, but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass. Really, this is possibly the best looking IPA I’ve had. It’s looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges, and has a thick, sticky head. The taste is like 32, but a little more bite that I really liked. They’re knocking these beers out of the park lately.","Jun 09, 2018"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Rhode Island,4.58/5,"Pours a very hazy, cloudy orange body with a two finger white head that reduces to a layer and leaves spotty lacing.

This is a real winner. Delicious and so flavorful, yet balanced and delicate.","May 29, 2018"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,Massachusetts,4.63/5,"Dated 5/18/18 on the bottom of the can, one week since brewing.

Pours an opaque soft pale yellow in the glass with a finger of dense white head. Huge pungent citrus aromas upon cracking open the can; followed by a light earthiness, fresh pineapple, fresh apricot, summer flowers, honey and a light wheat cracker. Taste matches the nose, think of a citrus marmalade w/ honey on a wheat cracker. At the end of the taste I get a little bit of ruby grapefruit pith and pine resin. Fantastic! I'm a big fan of honey added to IPAs and this really hits the spot. If you've had Buzz from Night Shift, this is that brews bigger sibling with a PhD. Super refined and smooth. Mouthfeel is a smooth medium with a little bit of prickly carbonation, low dryness but a medium- bitter kick at the very end of the sip. Not the stereotypical fruit smoothie, it's got both a detectable honey sweetness and ruby grapefruit bitter kick. I wish I picked up more of these cans during this batch!","May 26, 2018"
Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,,California,4.57/5,"This beer has the beautiful yellow appearance of egg whites, which might be tacky if it weren't backed up by an excellent smell of citrus and peach and a delectable taste of tangerines and brown sugar.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,,Idaho,4.79/5,"This is probably the first beer I'm reviewing that you could consider a holy elixir, as Abbaye de Brogne is a brewery located in an abbey in Belgium since St. Peter appeared to Gérard de Brogne, a nobleman who lived around 20 km or so away from the abbey, and instructed the knight to build an abbey to honor God.

That story, allegedly, took place somewhere around 880 AD, making this a very old abbey indeed.

But in 2013, Belgian brewmaster Bruno Deghorain, along with his business partner, Gaby Smet conceived a plan to set up a small brewery in the abbey, with the intent to make abbey style Belgian ales like they did in the days of yore.

This beer, Trappistes Rochefort 10, is part of that dream.

Is it any good? Is this a holy beer?

Let's find out!

CLASSIFICATION:

It's an ale, and when it comes to Belgian beers, there's a few styles.

Here we're enjoying a Belgian Quad, which are rich, strong ales with bold flavors. Typically, they're quite dark in color, hovering around deep ruby reds and browns with garnet hues.

In terms of taste, they're very sweet on the palate, low bitterness, but packing an ABV that will getcha there.

When it comes to beer, Belgian Quads are some of my favorite beers next to stouts.

COLOR:

Caramel, a deep caramel almost as if you left it on the burner a bit too long and it got dark brown. Nice hefty butterscotch colored head that lingers for a long time.

AROMA:

Very malty on the nose, which is the dominant smell that I'm getting. A little bit in the background is a faint hint of milk chocolate. Little bit of caramel and brown sugar.

BODY & PALATE:

Malt and caramel on the palate. There's a faint spritz of clove that I taste. Little bit of a fruity taste that comes in, almost like wine in a sense. I do want to stress it's quite mild in that fruity taste, which I guess is that faint hint of citrus that I'm attributing to these particular kind of hops that they use.

In terms of mouthfeel, it's pretty dense, almost like Coca-Cola in that sense. Very smooth, even for the ABV of 11.6% and fizziness of the beer.

FINISH:

It ends on a Belgian, malty dark chocolate sorta finish. This beer lives and dies by its malt character.

CONCLUSION:

This is a heavy beer that's akin to snuggling up in your favorite blanket and bunny slippers and sitting by the fire. It lives and dies by its rich malty flavor that hangs around.

I definitely do not recommend this beer for a refreshing drink. This is more of an experience, a beer you savor.

As far as holy, well, I'll leave that judgment to those more suited to make that call, as I'm not particularly religious.

But, I bet if Jesus had a signature beer, I bet this would be his beer of choice.

As far as myself, this has shot up to one of my favorite beers of all time, and this brewery became one of my favorite breweries of all time. They're a gem. Only issue though is availability and price. If you can find it, they are pricey, so if you're after a nice beer on a budget, might want to look elsewhere.

But, you definitely get what you pay for, this beer is wonderful!

Until next time...

Cheers!","Sep 08, 2023"

Trappistes Rochefort 10,,England,3.18/5,"Apparently this is one of the best beers in the world...so reviewing again. Many think that it is better than Westerveleren 12. 

Aroma is nothing special, similar to a canned Pelforth Brune. Lots of large bubbles, not as beautiful as Westerverelen or a Guinness. And definitely not a Chouffee IPA or Duvel Tripel Hop. But as the froth reduces, it improves.

The best thing about this beer is the hop aftertaste. It's one of the best mouthfeels of any beer. Really amazing. But it doesn't compare with a Chouffe IPA in terms of flavour for me.","Jun 23, 2023"
Trappistes Rochefort 10,,Massachusetts,4.38/5,"Allowed to acclimate to 50°F (a little too cold, but I let it warm more) and poured into a Chimay goblet.

Pours a hazy carob brown with lighter sediment floating around and a tan quickly dissipating tan head (forgot to pay attention to how tall).

Initial aroma is a slight smell of high alcohol, with a hefty dose of yeast and malt, slight notes of milk/semisweet chocolate wafted around before I smelled it directly. Returning for a second round of smelling I notice a slight note of grass. A third round reminding me of a general whiskey smell.

Initial taste is again, alcohol, followed by malt, followed by milk/semisweet chocolate, followed by light alcohol burn all over the tongue but concentrated in the middle. Third and fourth sips yield raisin and/or generic dark dried fruit notes upfront, as well as revealing a sweetness, similar to the natural sweetness of dried fruit. Sipping after that uncovered a spiciness that comes before the sweetness, combined with the warmth from the alcohol it feels very sensible. I have to admit that for me personally it becomes harder to drink as it warms more because I have a hard time with spirits, and the alcohol in this one is not hidden, but it's still got fantastic flavor.

Mouthfeel is smooth, although a little thin, and the carbonation disappears.

It tastes like a fireplace, super cozy and tastes like home kind of beer. This is the perfect beer to drink while wearing a cotton sweater by a fireplace or a library or den.

It's expensive but it can be justified because it's excellent and has a high ABV. Will absolutely be purchasing again, as well as recommending and purchasing the others in the line.","May 11, 2023"

Trappistes Rochefort 10,,Canada (BC),4.77/5,"Look: Poured a dark, cloudy brown with a 3-finger persistent head. Moderate amount of sediment as it's unfiltered. A little bit of foam lingers with some fingers around the edges.

Smell: Malt, bananas, toffee, raisins. Delicious.

Taste: Wow. Incredible. The malt profile takes you through almost every nuance you can get out of malt. You get the light breadiness of a wit, the bitter bite of an ESB, the sweet chocolate notes of a porter, just flowing from one to another. The notes in the nose (banana, toffee, raisin) are present as well, but playing second fiddle to the malt. There's a slight sour funk that many abbey ales have, but it's fairly muted compared to everything else going on. This is a beer lover's beer, and I think that's why it's so loved on here. I certainly love it.

Feel: Pleasantly effervescent, medium body (not thick and oily like a stout, but certainly not thin), a little bit of texture in the last sip because of the sediment but that's normal.

ABV: 11.3%
Serving Temp: low 50s F


Look: 
Cloudy and opaque chestnut brown with a 1-finger fizzy dark tan head. The head dissipates to a thin ring and thick island cover. Lacing is OK.

Smell: 
Sweet fruits, especially dark ones. Brown and some Candi sugar. A nice note of vanilla There is an underlying toasted malt note as well.

Taste: 
Very similar to the aroma with the addition of figs and baking spices. There is a faint dryness as the sip progresses. Things do not get overly sweet nor fruity. The sip finishes semi-sweet with a nice notes of baking spices and a nip of booze (which isn't surprising nor unwelcome).

Feel: 
Smooth and velvety with a slight warmth. The body is medium-full.

Overall:
An outstanding Quad. I am not an overly big fan of Quads (I tend to find them too sweet or fruity), but I really like this one. My bottle is more than a tad old - it is over 3 years past it's best-before date. And the beer is still quite good.

Trappistes Rochefort 10,,Idaho,4.24/5,"Thick, lovey head on it. Smells rich and cool; caramel, raisin, prunes, cherry, slightly earthy, and spice. Taste is even richer than expected. Upfront is the prune and cherry, which are a bit tart, but then comes raisin and caramel to bring some sweetness, and then the sweetness of the dark fruits arrives, a bit syrupy even. The spice comes out mostly on the finish, along with more raisin and a big hit of booze. It’s quite prickly on the tongue, which manages to surprise me through the entire beer, which combined with the booziness makes for a real slow sipper. 
A powerful, rich, delicious beer. A great example of how sweet and fruity can be done without becoming cloying.","Nov 13, 2022"

Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate and caramel forward with coffee, vanilla and maple syrup adding a variety of dimensions; finishes with lingering roast and maple syrup

Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice milk stout that avoids the cloying sweetness that plagues many of the beers of this style; the way the roasted malt and coffee offsets the sweetness of the caramel and maple syrup is impressive

Impermanence,,Massachusetts,4.59/5,"Canned “Autumn 2022“

For the second time in one Tree House run, we have yet another TH beer in the BA top 250! This one currently sits at #168, and #2 for Milk Stouts, just under their own Moment Of Clarity. Funnily enough, they are both Milk Stouts aduncted with coffee, chocolate, and maple syrup. Let’s crack it open and see how they differ

Pours completely pitch black with 3 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

The nose is very sweet and maple-forward, but there’s a delicate balance from the roast. I’m picking up on aromas of sweet maple syrup, vanilla, milk chocolate truffle, caramel, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light nougat

Once again in taste, there’s a lot of maple, but the balance is even more amazing here. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet maple, toasted oak, dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light coconut, and dark caramel. The swallow brings notes of sweet maple, chocolate fudge, dark caramel, toasted oak, brown sugar, medium roast coffee, and light molasses

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a creamy but not syrupy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but not overly sweet

In a word; wow. Maybe I’m a sucker for maple in Stouts, 2 of my all time top 10 beers are just that, but this is truly awesome. Even better than Moment Of Clarity. Tree House strikes again with this long time want of mine","Oct 02, 2022"

Impermanence,,Connecticut,4.31/5,"Excellent head production and good retention. Overall, an attractive beer.

Tons of maple on the nose; it's definitely the dominant characteristic, followed by coffee and the rich malt base. I don't get much chocolate standing out from the malt.

Flavor is more balanced: up front, it's a stout, through and through. The maple doesn't take long to show its presence, but it's a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose. This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate. The result is more in line with a breakfast beer (a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) than a dessert beer - which seems to be the goal, based on the description.

Maple, wood, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, cream. The flavor really grows; I wasn't blown away by the first sip, but I'm liking it more and more.

An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness. While the maple winds up being the star (as so often is the case when adding maple syrup), it's still a pretty well-balanced beer, with plenty of bitterness. It's very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV. It lets you know it's pretty big, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it.","Oct 03, 2021"

S: Aromas of chocolate malted, caramel, maple syrup, and mocha.

Sweet milk stouts aren’t my favorite stouts to be honest. I’ll take a bitter Expedition or Darkness any day. But this one has enough balance that I was able to drink 16oz without being overwhelmed. It’s a great beer for the style. More maple forward than anything but not too much like the Surly 13 Anniversary I had recently that was really disappointing. Super thick and full bodied.

Impermanence,,Connecticut,3.58/5,"The concept of inundating a brew with ingredients may work in the world of IPA, but it does not (IMO) in the world of stout. The balance is lost completely. This pours like sickly treacle or motor oil and its so heavy bodied it drinks like sludge. Way too sweet. Yes, imperial stouts almost always knock your socks off with strength, but usually there are some understated flavors that carry themselves gracefully... this lacks all nuance. Its too much. American brewers are often guilty of being overly ambitious and pushing their brews too far away from tradition... this is a perfect example of pushing a stout to the point of being un-drinkable, to where it no longer is beer... and in that regard, it is successful. This is an ice cream topping.","Apr 25, 2020"

smell: intense maple/brown sugar

taste: maple, brown sugar, chocolate, coffee, no boozy, no cloying (that surprised me). very pleasant. also both the smell and taste are very complex, kind like it's aged, I think this has something to do with the high abv.

feel: this one is heavy, foamy, creamy, dense, sweet caramel finish, wow!

BDCS,,West Virginia,4.11/5,"12oz can, tulip, 2021 vintage. 

Oily, almost black, and nearly still. There is a thin head that’s quite dark brown. 

Hershey’s syrup, vanilla, rich bourbon, some soy sauce, and it’s vinous, with overripe red grape and fruit. The bourbon isn’t over the top, rather it’s woody, rich, and elegant. 

Ok, now that fat juicy grape bursts and mixes with melting chocolate bar, blackberry jam, walnut, and strong vanilla in the finish. The chocolate is a backdrop, weaving together Hershey’s syrup, dark chocolate Milky Way, and cocoa powder. The grape flavor is surprising in its strength. 

Very smooth, medium bodied, light and discrete carbonation. 

The flavors are intense and rich even though the body isn’t super rich. The bourbon is well done.","Nov 06, 2021"
BDCS,,Indiana,4.37/5,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a dark tan head. Little carbonation was visible. 

Smell - The nose was just like chocolate marshmallows. It was big and sweet, signifying a sugar bomb. 

Taste - The taste was not as sweet as the nose. It was chocolatey bourbon with a dry grape presence. There were notes of leather and coffee. As it warmed, I was made to think of hydrox cookies, and their dry chocolate notes. This was definitely not an overt dessert stout. 

Mouthfeel - There was just a bit of carbonation and a slick body. 

Overall - A solid barrel aged stout that left me confused about the hype.","Sep 18, 2021"
BDCS,,Colorado,4.78/5,"Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass.

The pour is slick dark brown like used motor oil. It leaves a small layer of creamy tan foam in it's wake. Smells like bourbon, char, ripe dark fruit and molasses. The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth. 

It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years. It holds its own and brings a pleasant plethora of sensory delight without being overwhelming. This is the closest I've come to rating a 5 in a long time.

BDCS,,Connecticut,4.14/5,"2020 vintage (released in 7/2020); consumed on 2/1/21

Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur.

Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics.

Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV.","Feb 02, 2021"
BDCS,,Washington,4.48/5,"2020 vintage opened on 11/22/2020

Taste of sweet milk, chocolate, vanilla, warm barrel character, finishes with a balanced soy flavor. Feel of 2% milk with mild carb. Overall, what a nice treat, great base beer that is exemplified by the barrel.","Nov 22, 2020"

BDCS,,Washington,4.55/5,"L: Black as pitch brew. No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku.
A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.

S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms.

T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose.
Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste.

F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience.

O: I didn’t set out for a verbose review, but while so many BA Stouts fall short of my local Fremont’s, this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety! A stellar brew on the nose especially, which deserves to be tried by stout-lovers the world over!","Jun 23, 2020"
BDCS,,Washington,4.11/5,"Immediately upon popping open the tab on this one I can tell I'm in for something rich and delicious. A dark liquid pours forth, Nearly jet black with a tight but creamy soft looking rich brown espresso head that lingers and lingers. Beautiful sticky lacing as well. This is gorgeous. 

Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start. 

Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose.","Apr 05, 2020"

Smell- Caramel/toffee type malts, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, bourbon and oak, roasted nuts (praline candies in particular), licorice, toasted dark bread and dark fruits (raisins and dates), a bit of vanilla. Light spice notes.

Taste- Rich caramel malt, bourbon and barrel, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and dried dark fruits, licorice, roasted nuts, burnt sugar, light spicy hops and a bit of cherry and coconut.

Flavor profile is deep and expressive, hitting notes of caramel, vanilla, oak, chocolate, toffee, and bourbon. Roasty, toasty, caramely malts add a firm foundation for the sugary notes. Dark and expressive. Mouth feel is thick with a velvety, creamy texture that carries just a touch of grittiness. Overall, dark and expressive, and yet far from overly complex or mind numbing.

BDCS,,New Jersey,4.61/5,"Good afternoon, NBS! Some yard work and additional gardening done this morning and now moving onto this one courtesy of 

I’ve been shirtless in my backyard for most of the day. Neighbors haven’t complained of blindness yet, so I’m gonna keep this going as long as I can. 

This beer is a “want” after seeing it reviewed around these parts. It’s a new state tick and a new brewery for me. 

Look: As we approach the low 80’s with a cool breeze, this beer pulled from my 38 degree fridge is sweating. Almost as much as me. The beer should quickly reach my ideal temperature for the style. The frothy, two finger, espresso foam colored head settles down to a finger, leaving thick globs of lacing. As I work my way through the beer the head disappears leaving a thick ring of foam around the edge of my glass and some streaks of foam on the glass. The liquid is absent of color, opaque and devoid of visible carbonation. An appropriate looking stout. 

Nose: This beer had a distinctive smooth creaminess on the nose. It’s not the biggest BBA Stout nose I’ve experienced, but it is unique and delightful. Soft oak, vanilla, coffee, milk chocolate. A hint of meaty roast and some fresh pumpkin aroma, followed by a cinnamon spicyness. Zero indication of the ABV. 

Taste: Coffee with cream, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, chocolate covered raisins. Soft and sweet bourbon notes. This beer is sweet, but not cloyingly so. 

Mouthfeel: This beer nails the mouthfeel for me. It’s so smooth and creamy. Low carbonation and a full feel that perfectly complements and elevates the flavor profile of a bourbon barrel aged stout done right. A hint of dry toast and bitter oak on the finish. Sticky, residual sweetness on my lips. 

Overall: This stout does not have the biggest nose, although it is very nice. The flavor is amazingly smooth and creamy, and the mouthfeel puts this beer over the top for me. The flavor is defined by caramel, toffee and fudge notes for me, and it’s delectable. As stated on the can, this is “honest beer” ad a result off “hard work.” Both of these qualities are obvious. This drink is an example of beer done right, at an ABV that suits the style without being excessive for the sake of excess alone. Hands down one of the best and most drinkable BBA stouts I’ve ever had.

BDCS,,Illinois,4.99/5,"Given to me by @jvgoor3786, and damn, am I glad for that! This is a real great beer. To quote Monty Python, black as the ace of spades, he was, with slightly brownish/purple thinning edges. Had half a fingertip of quickly dissipating head that left a minimal amount of lacing. Smell is a balanced mixture of bourbon barrel, chocolate, and malt. Well, maybe the barrel is more prevalent than the other two. On taste, however, it’s a lot more balanced between the three, with a little bit of vanilla and a bit of a fruity red wine note in there for good measure. Everything comes together-it’s sweet, roasty, and has a tangy, woodsy burn from the barrel. Feel is maybe where this outstanding beer is most outstanding. It’s big and bold from the barrel, but there’s some subtle silky smoothness from the malt and sweet adjuncts. Mouth watering and a healthy alcohol presence. The only thing I can say about it being ranked in the top 250 beers is that 172 may be too low.

Pseudo Sue,,Rwanda,4.47/5,"Poured from the 16oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a bright hazy orange color, murky and opaque, topped with a 2 finger fizzy off-white head. I am thinking I will need to fight comparisons to King Sue, but for the appearance, it isn't as ""milky"" as I would have described the other beer. It is a little duller. It looks like a very hazy IPA.

Smell is very strong and refreshing and apparent from some distance away, even when just opening the can. Quite tropical. Orange and citrus rind. Grapefruit juice. Pineapple, mango. Balance upon further inspection in some bready malt within. Some piney hop in the mix, but not as much as advertised or described by other reviewers, in my opinion.

Taste has a bit more of the pine notes, but it also more balanced with a more malty character than anticipated. Biscuit. Honey. It is lacking some of the heat I perceived in King Sue, but that is a good thing. Smooth. Fruit again is tropical with a lot more orange and mango. Tropical notes throughout, but balanced with a dryness. Finishes with a touch of pine.

Drinkable. Accessible. This is possibly a gateway beer that I would introduce others to craft with. But that being said, it is far from bland. In many ways, this is what I want most hazy IPAs to be. Balanced, refreshing, tropical, flavorful. Even (almost) sessionable. I wouldn't call it ""exciting"" (some of the best beers are not) but I would call it world-class for the style. Does exactly what you want.","Jul 06, 2023"

Pseudo Sue,,Florida,3.8/5,"We tasted this beer, and we all were pretty much in agreement.
Nice color, fast dissolving head, and a somewhat pleasant nose.
Citrus or grapefruit came through on the nose, but it wasn't overpowering.
It was clean and crisp on the mouthfeel, but average on the flavor.
Tasted like a plain old beer. Not much bite. Although it wasn't too dry or bitter on the backside, which is a plus.
I wouldn't call it a ""good"" beer, just average.

Pseudo Sue,,Georgia,4.37/5,"Had on draft at Summit's here in Snellville with a price tag of $8.99.
LOOK: Arrived in a 16 oz glass a thick very hazy dull gold with a white finger all white head that slowly faded.
AROMA: Hoppy citrus with a dank perhaps pine nut undertone. Also get some mango, orange scent, land a scent of bread malts.
TASTE: Seems like more of an IPA. Hoppy citrus a little bitterness. Very tasty, very drinkable, and a real winner.
Medium bodied, quite carbonated., finishes clean and dry.","Mar 30, 2023"
Pseudo Sue,,Georgia,4.16/5,"(Note: To the extent that it's doable, my numerical ratings reflect the average score of my enjoyment of the beer and how well the brewery delivered on their own description of it, when an average falls between a usable number, I round up in favor of the brewery)

A: Pronounced and soapy off-white, six-finger head, medium retention with nice lacing and a hazy, golden orange body. 

S: Immediate grapefruit and citrus and the mango while subtle is here, as is the pine.

  T: This beer balances fairly well what is here, the bitterness in the finish is mild as promised, the sweetness of mango comes through here as do the flavors of citrus and grapefruit but I would argue that the mango dominates, the cheesy effect of heavy dry hopping is very prominent here.

 M: Medium body, gentle carbonation. 

 O: So I do think this beer generally does what it aims to do and for that I must certainly commend it, but here’s the catch, I find the hazy styles to be a bit boring and that’s going to show in my final score. I’m still trying to judge this as it relates to the hazy (I)PA style and if you’re going to do that, to my mind you need to be aggressive, they say that that was not their intention and I’ll reflect that in their score, but I’ll reflect my preference in mine.

End note: I wrote more than is here, but I thought I would spare everyone my justifications for my scoring.","Mar 26, 2023"
Pseudo Sue,,Colorado,4.03/5,"16oz canned on 1/12/23

On the pour a finger of white foamy head was present that over a few minutes became rocky and more foamy but settled out only losing half it's height. Good retention. Body is hazy like pineapple juice, but darker like orange. Leaves some decent lacing.

Aroma is basically your modern IPA, big citrus with some pineapple and mango. I'm going to call Citra POG from now on, I swear.

Taste is surprisingly smooth with low bitterness, and all the hop flavor. Tastes of floral and herbal pineapple and mango with a hint of lemon, but not tart. Some light malt shows itself in the background but it isn't prominent. A slight resinous note pops up in the finish.

Feel is full and smooth, but quite dry. Medium finish. Feel matches ABV. There may be oats in the mashbill, but I wouldn't put money on it.

Overall this feels like the predecessor to the NEIPA. Big hop flavor with less focus on malt. It is good, and it is very drinkable, but not my favorite beer ever personally.

People that aren't into beer might mistake this for one of the fruitier strains of weed, in terms of aroma.","Mar 19, 2023"

Pseudo Sue,,Texas,3.97/5,"Canned on 11/04/2022, exactly four months old at the time of review. I generally tend to drink hoppy beers within 90 days of their canning date, but I'm taking a chance.

Pours a hazy, juicy, golden in color with hints of copper along with a finger thick sudsy head which dissipates to a thin layer of lacing and bubbles over time. Plenty of lacing as you drink. Carbonation is hard to see unless you swish the beer around in your glass, hoping that means not overly carbonated with a bit of zest. Not your typical pale ale look, more like a hazy IPA, but it does look refreshing.

Very juicy on the nose as well. White grape, mango, citrus, a hint of pine. Not getting too much in the way of malts, but I do note some breadiness in the background. I expected this to be a bit more aromatic, maybe it will be as it warms.

Stop me if I sound repetitive, but the taste is also juicy with pineapple, mango, grapefruit and some pine towards the swallow. The malts stay out of the way, only adding some subtle bready balance to the mix. A little bit of alcohol detectible. Finishes quite bitter and a tad dry with lingering grapefruit rind on the tongue. It's not bad, but the flavor profile comes off a bit ""flat"" to me. It's also a tad simple, but when you consider it's a single hop it actually has quite a lot of complexity.

Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with fairly zesty carbonation. There is some chewiness to it, but it comes off a bit thin and mineral watery. The dry finish doesn't help. It's certainly drinkable, but not my favorite mouthfeel for a beer.

I can see why this is popular, it's basically a session NE style hazy IPA. Maybe the cans I got were too old to properly appreciate this beer, so I may try to pick up some fresher ones if I can find them and update my review here. Otherwise, this is a fine beer but not what I'd typically seek out for a pale ale, and I was a bit disappointed with the flavor profile and mouthfeel. Still, it is solidly above average and worth trying out, especially if you are a big fan of hazy IPAs and want to drink more than a few without feeling it the next day. Cheers!","Mar 04, 2023"
Pseudo Sue,,Canada (ON),4.64/5,"Pours the color of an orange creamsicle with a giant rocky head that lasts forever. The aroma is a slap of Citra goodness - stonefruit, citrus, mango, pineapple. The taste follows suit with an ever expanding wall of tropical hops. Resinous around the edges. Light, crackery malts way at the back. The mouthfeel is full bodied and teeming with luscious carbonation. High bitterness and loads of fruitiness in the long finish.

This mellowed out as I drank and by the end of the glass it was tasting like a super hoppy and hazy IPA should. I never had anything else brewed in Iowa, so I guess this is their style?

L: slightly-hazy medium amber-colored liquid; not a huge head on the pour, but it's tight with a frayed cotton contour... only holds a thin collar, thin misty cap; does leave a big band of lace oppo of sip spot

S: very floral initial pop (rosewater), followed by some fleshy orange pulp, lemon/grapefruit zest, background hint of pine... a little honeyish malt wants to poke through... gummy orange slices... only a soft essence of alcohol... excellent overall intensity

T: citrus kiss, but a rush of florality right behind it... the aftertaste is spicy, with a green bitterness that slowly swells... certainly a big malty base, with a muffin/cakey quality, but it's sodden with hop resins... vague dried pale-colored fruit (apricot, sultana) slowly creeps into the aftertaste, while the residual bitterness grows some peppery hair to it... the volume on the bitterness just keeps increasing, speakers cracking and shaking; hop artifacts emerge

F: its bitter bite takes hold on the tongue, mildly intensified by the ethanol, which sets and singes (and yet cools?!) a touch near the back of the palate... its body and resins make for a silky lusciousness up front, giving way to a growing heat; soft carbonation

O: why did this take so long to be released out east here(?), especially considering Furious had been here for years now; this was the first Surly beer I ever heard of c. 2011 (though Darkness and Bender weren't far behind)...

Abrasive Ale,,Pennsylvania,4.85/5,"I am so happy to have finally found this locally (PA) after searching for it for years. It did not disappoint. While the can is over a couple of months old, the ale still tasted very fresh. I rate it as having a NE flavor profile while having a west coast appearance. It is translucent and golden, but definitely not cloudy. The head was white and not too foamy. The aromas came in waves of sweet fruit. The flavor came in waves and it seemed each one was a different type of tropical fruit. What a fantastic drinking experience. The only downside was the $5 price tag, but that would be a bargain in a tavern.","Jan 12, 2023"
Abrasive Ale,,Wisconsin,4.24/5,"Canned 11/7/22 (1 month ago)

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy (80% clarity) medium orange color with a strong white head. SRM of 9. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich grapefruit, tropical mango and melon. Resinous, earthy, and tropical. Some tropical peach evolves as it warms. (4.25) 

Flavor: Flavors follow the nose with strong tropical grapefruit, pineaple, mango/melon with a sweet peach undertone. A moderate balance of sweet and smooth caramel balanced by bitter pine notes. (4.25)

Feel: Heavier bodied, strong carbonation and finishes sweet, but surprisingly clean and drinkable on the palate. (4.25) 

Compared to Revolution Anti-Hero IPA 12/2022: Pours lighter, stronger aromas. More juicy grapefruit, tropical pineapple, melon, and peaches. Less resinous nectarine and syrup. Juicier, but also more balanced with pine bitterness. Winner: Surly

Compared to Surly Axe Man 2/2023: Pours darker, hazier. Stronger aromas. More sweet and juicy tangerine and peach. Less dank berry and pine notes. 

Overall: Wow a surprisingly fantastic IPA here. Grapefruit, tropical pineapple, mango/melon, and peach flavors. Juicy with enough pine and grapefruit citrus rind to balance. Beldns NEIPA juicy flavors with west-coast body and mouthfeel. Sort of reminds me of Half Acres IPA blends and not unlike Axe Man in many ways. (Rating: 4.24)","Dec 14, 2022"

Abrasive Ale
Surly Brewing
Imperial IPA
Date: 17 Dec 2021
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent. 
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal. 
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank. 
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers. 
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.","Feb 28, 2022"

Taste is tropical fruit, caramel, honey, citrus, grapefruit and a nice piney bitter finish. Citrus. Some stone fruit - apples, pear, peach. Fairly high ABV is hidden well even as the beer warms. The malt bill tastes substantial with a sweet bready backbone for the hops to flesh out.

Mouth is oily and coating with a nice viscosity and an astringent finish.

Abrasive Ale,,North Dakota,4.65/5,"Poured into a glass suited for beer, one-half inch of foam which recedes quickly. The beer is not clear but not hazy.

And there is a dankness and resiny undertone that is pleasant, ABV is hidden well.

This is my favorite double IPA but I continue to have a difficult time saying why. A reviewer said it was ""gestalt' which is a fancy way of saying it all comes together well without any attribute of the beer sticking out.

Citrus rind and fresh pine finish with a deep hop bitterness that is more assertive than abrasive. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. I think I would have loved this even years ago, but it is even more welcome now with all the mild, soft hopped hazy ales that are so popular now. This is what I want in an IPA: great herbal hop flavors melded to aggressive alpha oil character. And this delivers. The strong ABV brings out the flavors to a fine degree.

Midnight Still,,California,4.33/5,"Poured oily black with a brown head. Most of the head disappeared pretty quickly, but coated the edges of the glass like the ring of a solar eclipse. Aromas of leather, pipe tobacco, coconut pudding, black cherries.
Flavors are rich, with a ton of dark chocolate, oaky bourbon, and charred marshmallow.
Mouthfeel is full, and the dense carbonation smooths it out. Finishes dry with dark chocolate bitterness on the palate.","Mar 12, 2021"
Midnight Still,,Connecticut,4.18/5,"2020 vintage (released on 2/14/20, so presumably bottled within a few days of that date); consumed on 2/4/21

Pours a glossy, motor-oil black body topped with a barely-formed, mocha head, quickly fizzling to a spotty array of paper-thin islands of cap, expansive, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of short-lived, webby lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma expresses dulled notes of brownie batter cut with boggy ethanol as a slight black raspberry accents upfront; dark chocolate, caramel, and touches of pipe tobacco develop sparingly against a core focused intently on rawer bourbon tones and distinctly wet oak barrel; some molasses and burnt brown sugar factor in toward the back end.

Taste bursts intently with waves of silky drinking chocolate, refined and creamy while leveled with a slight nuttiness; molasses progresses as the bourbon character deepens, forming notes of caramel brittle, burnt marshmallow, and brown sugar over the mid-palate as coffee bean meets bittersweet, malty char on the back end; a slightly smoky, ashy char finishes.

Mouthfeel brings put a fluid medium body elevated with a timely, fluffy burst of carbonation rounding into a silky grit over the mid-palate; heavy roast expands on the back end to counterbalance a growing bitterness with ample char, while a slightly sticky character gently coats the palate into an otherwise moderately dry finish.

From initial impressions of muddled heat and subdued malts, a level of forward, confident brilliance is expressed in equal parts sweetness and roast; the final product is an amazing flow of enveloping character, seemingly unending in its influx of intrigue and detail despite any apparent shortcomings.","Feb 05, 2021"
Midnight Still,,Maine,4.52/5,"2020 vintage - split with jrc1093 because wowweeweewoah what a champ he is.

Pours a seemingly fluid deep midnight black. A very minimal dark mocha head recedes fast leaving a persistent bubbly collar. The beer clings to glass, draping down and staining it brown. Oil spill. 

Nose: Aroma opens very strong and saturated. Notes of bourbon-soaked brown sugar, drippy molasses, burned soft caramel, English toffee, demerera sugar, encapsulated by very heavily charred oak. The roast lends some milk chocolate, cacao nib, and a deep burnish character. Some bramble dark fruit and current highlight brightness, with ethanol fumes are quite apparent, and paired with this densely musty, sopping oak character, detracts from the otherwise rich depth. 

Palate: Waves of rich, silken, malt-driven fudgy roast, caramel, toffee, cacao nib, burned brown sugar, and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent, before an almost unrealistic degree of flame-charred, bourbon-soaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly. Big burly bourbon notes, with toffee, coconut, pipe tobacco, vanilla caviar, and an almost bark-like tannin structure. The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness, and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: Shying away from the thick, vicious, chewy theme, Midnight Still manages to deliver all the fudgy richness from the malt, with the sweetness fading by the finish, and replaced by dense, oily barrel. A nice fluidity allows it to remain drinkable, without ever approaching cloying, surrounded by a soft, fluffy carbonation. 

Overall: There's so much going on here that seems so unique to this beer. This is not a replica of another - it is not a waxed Bourbon County. This is a beautifully seamless execution of balance between malt complexity and full-on bourbon barrel assault, with the only real thing dragging it down is the ethanol and musty earthiness in the aroma. This is one for the books.","Feb 05, 2021"
Midnight Still,,Washington,5/5,2020 Edition. Bourbon Milky Creamy Delicacy.,"Feb 02, 2021"
Midnight Still,,Nevada,4.34/5,"Had this Sep 3, 2016 as part of corpulent's birthday jam. Drank this at that golf course I can't remember the name of up at Lake Tahoe. 

Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance. Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray. Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient. 

Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects. As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon. Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time. Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9. 

I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them. Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly. It is top notch.","Jun 19, 2020"
Midnight Still,,Massachusetts,4.77/5,"Novare Res Stoutfest 2020.

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace.

S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery.

T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE.

MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm.

The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years. A great surprise to be able to drink this brew in Maine and one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Hopefully can visit this brewery again some day.","Jan 22, 2020"

Pours black as a butthole (an inky butthole?) with a thin dark tan head that reduces to a thin ring fairly quick. Taste is sweet with flavors matching the aroma; alcohol is hidden well, although it does warm the gut. Basically what we have here is a flawless barrel non-adjunct imperial stout that does everything the greatest in the world have to offer but doesn’t go any further than that. I can find nothing wrong here, but also I don’t see it pushing any pre-existing boundaries. If I can repeat myself, it’s flawless, delicious, and should be on any serious beer geek’s radar. There’s a peak when it comes to any style of beer, where it’s damn near impossible to go any further. Perfect is perfect, and that’s what this is. However, I can name a handful of beers I’ve had in my life in the same category that are of the same caliber, and they all nearly taste pretty much the same. I don’t think that’s a detriment, though. It’s just as far as a brewer can go within one particular style. This is about as far as you can go in a barrel aged imperial stout with no adjuncts.","Jun 05, 2017"

Well I wasn’t expecting Bayberry to have the BA highest rated Berliner Weisse on tap for their 6th anniversary party, but I’m hyped that they do. Let’s get into it

Pours a clear ruby reddish with a finger of pinkish red head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

Honestly the nose on this one isn’t anything too impressive. I dig it but it’s a bit sweet. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry candy, passion fruit, pineapple juice, crackery malt, lemon zest, light dragonfruit, and vanilla

Oh no, I stand corrected, that is much better in taste. Nicely tart and well balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting passion fruit, underripe mango, lemon juice, apricot gummy, straw, apple cider vinegar, dragonfruit, and tart cherry. The swallow brings notes of lemon juice, pineapple juice, dragonfruit, cherry candy, crackery malt, underripe mango, and a touch of vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a a crisp beer. Finishes slightly sticky but the feel isn’t ruined by it

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing

We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.

Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.

MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose
HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans

On tap at Trillium Canton, 5oz snifter , black motor oil , thin dark brown big bubbled layer quickly settles to a ring

Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Missouri,4.62/5,"Big time want. Poured on draft at Trillium's Fenway location. Consumed and noted November 1st, 2021.

Pours black with a finger of caramel khaki colored foam. Aroma is dense chocolate and coffee, leaning on both in a near even split. Caramel adds a touch of sweetness. Roasty and toasty malts add a firm foundation, and while tipping the beer into the 'heavy and dark' category, lands shy of being light-absorbing dark. Barrel, bourbon, and some light booze comes on at the end, but the nose still leans more firmly towards 'sweet'. Coffee is full, providing a whiff of wonderful medium-bodied roast. Flavor profile is BIG chocolate, followed quickly by coffee. It's akin to taking a bite out of a Hershey's chocolate bar, followed by a sip of Colombian origin coffee done through a Chemex. Roasty and toasty malts are layered underneath, establishing a dark and firm base, without impeding on the leading notes. Barrel, char, and bourbon add some light heat at the end without tipping the scale towards boozy. Whole flavor profile leans slightly towards 'sweet', but not enough so that it's a dessert beer. Mouth feel is a gorgeous thick, full, dense, and creamy texture. Overall, coffee is sublime here, and are accented well via milk chocolate and bourbon. While packing quite an array of notes, and a high alcohol content, this beer goes down slippery smooth.

I'm surprised how complex, deep and rich this is. Having this so much later than all their other collaboration stouts, it's no wonder they all carried so much hype behind them. This is clearly their best work in the barrel aged collaboration stout series, and being their first, they set the bar high. A bar that, IMO, they never hit again.

Huge pastry stout but barely carbonated and too sweet to finish the glass.","Mar 24, 2019"

Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Massachusetts,4.49/5,"Thanks big time Kevin!

A- Motor oil elixir from the 750ml to a becher. A one finger light tan head has a foamy consistency and good retention. Small webs of lace.

S- Massive and sweet BA stout nose, you can just tell this is gonna be a big rich beast. A huge amount of barrel, coffee and roast grains. Espresso beans, dark chocolate, burnt barley, milk chocolate, heavily toasted nuts, toffee, peppery spicy whiskey, big vanilla, caramel and alcohol.

T- The booze and sweetness pickup and for the most part the big things get more prominent simplifying the experience somewhat. Spicy whiskey and medium toast oak with plenty of booze leading into the big sweets and dessert flavors. Vanilla is massive with caramel, toffee, roast barley, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, hersheys chocolate, deep roast espresso beans, fudge and some dark dried dark fruits like fig but those are mostly an afterthought.

MF- Heavy as it gets with a slightly frothy consistency and that syrupy oily sugar heft. Warm from the booze with medium carbonation.

A great mixture of a boozy whiskey barrel, dark chocolate grains and espresso.","Jan 02, 2019"

Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Alabama,4.47/5,"The whales continue to flow. Lots of hype surrounding this, but Trillium doesn’t often dissapoint.

A predictably dark beer; viscous, medium bodied pour without much noticeable head or lace.

Sweet, roasty nose. Milk chocolate comes through strong , but overall it’s a very subtle barrel barrel presence.

Awesome flavors, the highlight of the beer no doubt. Not overly sweet, with subtle tobacco and tons of semisweet chocolate and roast coffee to balance all the components. Hints of oak. Really good.

Body is medium in thickness with a good level of medium carb. Gives the beer a good feel, but doesn’t overpower it in any way.","May 27, 2018"
Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Massachusetts,4/5,"Pours pure dark, thin little head. Smells straight bourbon. Flavor is sweet and boozy, and roasty at the very end. Bourbon lovers rejoice -- but if you want a more tame beer, try the regular Affogato or the more flavorful Tiramisu.","May 16, 2018"

Affogato - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Massachusetts,4.37/5,"Enjoyed at the Copenhagen Beer Fest. Reviewed from notes.

A - Poured a nice dark black with a rather thin light head that faded rather quickly to leave light wisps.

S - Very, very nice aromas of coffee and chocolate syrup and fudge. There are some rather faint bourbon notes along with a little bit of barrel. Pleasant vanilla as well.

T - Taste is similar to the nose. Big, bold coffee aromas along with fudgy chocolate and brownies. The vanilla is quite pleasant along with some real good bourbon juice flavour and oak. No real alcohol either.

M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, creamy, thick.

O - Overall this was a very nice stout with excellent coffee and chocolate notes. Vanilla is quite nice as well as the bourbon. Would have been the stout star of the fest if not for a few others.

Susan,,Pennsylvania,4.87/5,"Golden amber with a modest and enduring off-white head, a full clear pint glass full just spilled out of a tap head. As with many hazies, this doesn't punch the nose, but it is pleasant. There's a pleasant starchy backing for resinous hops, which aren't at all that bitter to smell. There's a near perfect softness to the mouthfeel, just like a hazy styled AIPA should provide. Unlike too many others, it's neither too thin, nor too sticky. The same goes for the hopping. It, too, is close to perfect for the style. It's vaguely resinous, with a hint of a spice like lemongrass, coriander or pepper. With some nice glass lacing, this also looks close to perfect. Overall, this is one incredibly good beer. Outside of New England, this is a rare find. When it shows, beer geeks are on their phones to their buddies and it doesn't last long.","Mar 12, 2023"
Susan,,Germany,4.82/5,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

S: Hoppy and slightly malty with notes of ripe orange, honey, pines and stone fruits. Herbal and grassy.

T: Malty with caramelly and bready notes on the one side, hoppy with a fruity sweetness on the other side. Honey, peach and a bit of pineapple.

F: Crisp and crushable with a medium carbonation. Soft and smooth.

O: I think I've never had a beer with less than 8% ABV that was as complex and flavorful as this one. Even though it drinks almost as crisp as a lager, all kinds of malty and hoppy notes keep popping up. Absolutely outstanding.","Jan 17, 2023"
Susan,,Massachusetts,4.34/5,"Canned 12/13/22

Alright, it’s time. The highest rated American IPA on BA!! I’ve been wanting to try this one for quite some time, and I’m thrilled to finally get the opportunity to. I’ve been seeing more Hill Farmstead beers near me as time goes on, and I’m excited by all of it. Let’s see if it can truly live up to the hype

Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing

The nose is somewhat delicate, for lack of a better word, but still shows an excellent balance of all of its elements that ends up turning out really nice. I'm picking up on aromas of orange zest, pine sap, bready malt, grassy hops, honey, pineapple juice, white pepper, grapefruit zest, and light orange marmalade

In taste it falls a little bit flat of the complexity on display in the aroma, not exactly one-dimensional but more focused on bitterness. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting grapefruit zest, piney hops, bready malt, weed, white pepper, honey, light passionfruit, and pineapple. The swallow brings notes of crackery malt, white pepper, piney hops, fresh cut grass, honey, grapefruit zest, passionfruit, and light orange

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

While I think this is quite good, it's nothing mind blowing. There's better examples of the style out there, but I'd also like to try this fresher one day, as I've heard HF can be really particular about the best by dates on their IPAs","Jan 07, 2023"

Pours hazy gold with an inch-plus head of white. Plenty of tattered lacing and persistent retention. Tangerine, peach, and lemon-lime in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel. Juicy citrus on the palate with minimal malt and a balancing bitterness. Nectarine, peach and pink grapefruit. Finishes dry with a bitter backbone and lingering citrus.","Sep 18, 2022"
Susan,,Minnesota,4.51/5,"From a single tallboy (brought back from a NE vacation by a buddy), canned 6 weeks ago, into a La fin du monde tulip. If this is what 6 weeks out tastes like, what must it be fresh? Superb construction: gentle but full layers of tangerine, passion fruit, with an incredibly soft mouthful…next to no bitterness, but there is a kind of malty thickness that adds to and also restrains the fruity juiciness.

First beer I’ve ever had a chance to try from HF, and I wish it wasn’t an NEIPA, but even so, damn.","Sep 04, 2022"

Susan,,District of Columbia,4.49/5,"Can dated 8/30; best by 9/27:
Loved this beer originally two weeks ago, but these had on the best by date aren't jumping out at me quite as much. I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review.

That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge. The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque. As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong.

Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple. There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste.

Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges. More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains. Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose. The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it. Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand. As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience.","Sep 27, 2021"
Susan,,District of Columbia,4.61/5,"Pours a fairly hazy yellow-light orange. Wonderful passionfruit and orange hop flavors on the nose. The palate follows through with plenty of citrus and tropical hop flavors. A very refined, well-crafted beer where everything just works.","Sep 26, 2021"
Susan,,Illinois,4.46/5,"Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it.

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation.

This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive.","Aug 29, 2021"
Susan,,Connecticut,4.32/5,"Very, very attractive beer. Burned orange in color, but what really stands out is the gorgeous head. Dense, foamy & long lasting with extensive lacing. Aroma has lots of citrus & tropical notes, with orange being what jumps out at me the most. 

Taste has more of the tropical / citrus notes with the hops working well together. The orange detected on the nose is not present on the tongue, although some hints of grapefruit do come through. Amazingly full mouthfeel. Good beer.","Aug 01, 2021"
Susan,,Delaware,4.5/5,"Had this beer on tap at the Mule Bar in Winooski, Vermont, just outside of Burlington. Excellent!

Susan,,North Carolina,4.49/5,"Appearance: Pours a rather cloudy orangeade color with a two finger head; solid persistence and streaks of lace

Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix

Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting","Jul 31, 2021"
Susan,,Maryland,4.49/5,"Received from a friend in exchange for a collection of Equilibrium DIPAs/TIPAs...

L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging.
S: some clean, piney wafts along with a noseful of citrus and sugary-sweet hops (maybe the Riwaka?). Very appealing.
T: bright citrus scent on the nose makes its way down but is quickly subdued by dank and slightly bitter (WA state?) hops that make for a really interesting APA. 
F: mild carbonation, very quaffable. Hop bitterness lingers nicely. 
O: a near-perfect rating for good reason; this is a great take on a classic variety that has been overshadowed by the new shiny toy (NE/hazy IPAs). Fantastic beer.","Jul 05, 2021"

Susan,,New York,4.71/5,"Poured from a can (01Dec2020) into a Teku

L: pours a translucent more dull yellow orange with a nice and thick white head. As it fades leaves great large rings of lacing, as does each sip ~30 minutes post pour

S: get this excellent and layered tropical/grassy/vegetal aroma, slightly sweet with a bit of bitterness toward the back cutting through. Get passionfruit, peach (white peach, candy rings), melon, some citrus, papaya, slight grass, berries?

T: follows the nose so well, delivers what I hoped with a bit more of an earthy flavor to complement the fruit notes. Tropical fruit leads, getting that peach and melon from the nose along with passionfruit and I want to say mango? Immediately playing against the fruit is this earthier/grassy flavor that adds excellent depth for me. Toward the finish get a slight pithy citrus bitterness, mixed with those vegetal notes. There’s something about the flavor of this beer I can’t get over, simply love it

F: medium+ carbonation, medium body, call it medium drying (I want another sip but not desert inducing), very drinkable

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,,Colorado,4.37/5,"September 3rd, 2015 - When I leave San Diego, this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many, many beers I had. For one, I had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to San Diego. But it is also an amazing brew. To the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout, with a brown foam and a thick body, but not too oily. The aroma is big and bold, and cold and saturnine, like the smell of cold metal, but with some cacao nibs on the edge. The flavor is the real appeal here. Creamy, rich but not cloying, it is decadent, and deserving. Huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and top-shelf coffee notes, like Bird Rock coffee. Better yet, this beer gets spicier as it warms, like a Christmas ale, and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon. Could this be a rare 10 for flavor?!","Jun 24, 2019"

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,,Indiana,4.05/5,"Pouring this from a 16 oz. can into a tulip glass, this beer pours out absolutely beautiful. It’s pitch black and forms a two finger, creamy, thick, dark mocha colored crown. The crown holds well and leaves lacing. It would be hard for this to look much better. 

The nose brings roasty, dark malts more so than roasty coffee. However, there is a coffee presence. It also brings a bitterness to it that resembles bitter bakers chocolate; dark chocolate. A smooth cream note wants to show, but hardly does. Almost an earthy, peat like note?

The taste brings in a cream presence along with those roasty, slightly burnt malts. Bitter, dark chocolate still showing. A black pepper like spice shows up at the end, along with a little bit of an earthy wood/smoke presence. 

The mouthfeel is creamy underneath that black pepper and light earthy smoke presence. Hardly any sign of the 12% ABV, which is impressive. It does show a bitterness all the way through. I would say the body is on the light side of full bodied, thick and creamy but not fudge like.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,,Massachusetts,4.45/5,"Received this can as an extra back in the summer. Could have sworn I'd reviewed regular ol Vietnamese Coffee Speedway before, but upon further review I found out it was the incredibly rare draft only 'Brewers Blend' rendition I had back in 2012 and incorrectly reviewed under this regular version. Good memories for that beer thanks to JLindros! Canned on 4/25/18. Review #3500.

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice black hue with a good almost two finger dense mocha head that faded slowly to leave a thin, creamy blanket. Not really any lacing though the legs are nice enough.

S - Aromas of nice typical speedway stout. creamy chocolate, malts, almost caramel. The coffee is not super aggressive but a nice creamy espresso. Quite pleasant and creamy. Very Vietnamese like combined with the chocolate and creamy notes it has an almost coffee ice cream like aroma. Decent lighter roast too.

T - Taste is similar to the nose. Very nice creamy chocolate and roasted malts. Big and bold. Little bit of caramel and almost caramel cream candy like. There are flashes of warmth scattered here and there. The coffee is pleasant, not overly roasted and quite harmoneous with the base beer. Very nice rich coffee without being aggressive. Stays smooth and balanced. Finish is lingering roast with just a slight, slight coffee bitterness. 

M - Mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy with the alcohol hidden very well.

O - Overall this was a very, very pleasant stout. The coffee is great on the taste, however, I wish it popped a bit more on the nose. Same goes for the appearance, would like to see some lacing on this.

Slowly, finally, these really good breweries are starting distro in this area. Color is a dark brown. No obvious carbonation but a tiny sliver of head. To touch, the temp was cool to room temp. Aroma was very coffee forward, balanced like a breakfast blend smell. First sips were hot from the alcohol, followed by a smooth coffee presence from front to back of tongue. Mouthfeel was full and left a nice coffee, milk chocolate aftertaste. If I could find this bottled, definitely worth cellaring a few to see how the burn subsides and the flavors develop.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,,New York,4.86/5,"Luscious. The aroma and flavor are top notch for a coffee stout, delivering exactly what I’d hoped for.

On tap at Haymaker, NYC, I let it sit and warm as the black brew settled down and the brown head eased down to a nice little layer while leaving good spotty lacing.

The nose is a robust combo of coffee beans, spent coffee grinds, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, molasses, light soy sauce, roasted malts, charred wood and a malty sweetness from the toasted grains and perfectly blended coffee.

The feel is silky smooth and this hides the ABV masterfully, but hot damn I need to profess my love for how tasty the coffee flavors are....wow, delicious. Take the smell above and add in some black licorice, hints of peat moss, cocoa and/or cocoa powder, plus some minor piney notes and flavors that I get after sipping a dark roast Starbucks coffee. There’s a slight bitterness that adds to the experience and livens it up. Bravo.","Jul 27, 2018"

La Fosse,,Minnesota,4.4/5,"375ml bottle. Label has '2022' vintage.
Cloudy, straw colored body. Brief white head. No lacing.

Sublime nose and flavors, with apricot as the base note.","Jun 19, 2023"
La Fosse,,Texas,4.45/5,"Purchased a bottle of this beer at the brewery in March. 

Poured into a tulip glass. Hazy yellow color with brief effervescent white head with little lacing. Smell and taste of ripe, tart fruit. Apricot and peaches. Tart but a mellow smooth flavor. Nice full feel. Wonderfully refreshing. Excellent wild ale.","May 26, 2023"
La Fosse,,Kentucky,4.49/5,"Taking inspiration from famous Brussel's apricot sour ale, Side Project is brewing more like pros when brewing and aging their own unique spin on the fruited gueuze style.

La Fosse brings a golden tinge to an otherwise bubbly champagne pour. But the beer strikes the nose with force as the overwhelming sour scent tightens the jaws and wets the whistle with fruit, funk and fauna. A scantly sweet introduction is of light wafer, sourdough and a brief hint of taffy.

But anything seeming sweet is short and succinct on the middle palate. The session quickly favors the stone fruit with a light orange, mango and peach character. Shying away from fruit rollup, the beer quickly trends vinous and winey with sharp chardonnay, bubbly dryness and a piquant spice. Its bracing acidity washes any thirst from the palate as the late taste brings an earthen tone of balsa, burlap and extended wood-age white wine.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the ale is a cleaner taste compared to more Brussels brewed versions, but this brighter, cleaner and fruitier version is just as good.","May 02, 2023"
La Fosse,,Wisconsin,4.5/5,"Finally made it for a visit to Side Project and they happened to have bottles of this for on-site so got one and no regearts! Sour but not too sour and just fully of ripe, juicy apricot flavor; glad I got it!","Apr 28, 2023"
La Fosse,,California,4.51/5,"Drank as part of a beer tasting with Ron. Not sure about the price. Cool bottle, neat cap. Consumed on 04/07/23, review from notes.

A&S: The beer's appearance is bright orange at first and moves to a muddy orange as the remaining beer and sediment are poured in. The head is fizzy and big, there is some lacing. The aroma is powerful! Chalky yeast, tart peaches, and apricots.

T&M: The taste is acidic, fruity, tart, and lemony. Very clean. Cereal finish. Tartness is cleared out when the sediment is poured in and the funk comes through more than before. The high carbonation is champagne-like at first, then comes in a little more creamy later on.

Overall: It is one of the better beers I have ever had. Perfect for a warm summer day.","Apr 16, 2023"
La Fosse,,Illinois,4.51/5,"Here I was all ready to write how this reminded me so much of fuzzy but with strong apricot with orange, golden raisin, and peach leading instead, but then I read that is literally what this beer is..... nailed it! I will notes the drop of acid here are playful with bright oak and dry funk, seems lighter and more nimble than fuzzy, though not as potent, floral tones are lighter here too. Because of this I actually thought the mouthfeel was better than fuzzy with more dynamics and artful depth. I think in a toss up I would lean fuzzy but they are both excellent and well worth your time","Mar 24, 2023"
La Fosse,,Massachusetts,4.12/5,"B3, drank March, 2022 out of a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.

A classic that lives up to its style but too acidic for my tastes. Apricot shines through, smell was great, and I’m glad I got to try it and certainly did enjoy the experience of drinking it, but I had a hard time making it through 375 ml.","Mar 16, 2022"
La Fosse,,Missouri,4.34/5,"Blend #3.

Pours a golden-copper with notable floaties and particles suspended in the beer. Head is a finger of white foam. Aroma is lemongrass, herbal, stone, and apricot. Apricot isn't forward, molding into the surroundings for a subtle twist of sweetness. Nose has a light tanginess to it, but it's faint. Flavor profile is apricot forward, which lays on top of herbal, lemongrass, and stone. Finish is notably tangy and funky, much more so than the nose. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a near still effervescence. Overall, soft and plump, just like a ripe apricot.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle.","Feb 09, 2022"
La Fosse,,Missouri,4.34/5,"Gold in color with a faint haziness. There’s just a trace of off white on top. Smell is of fresh apricots and faint lactobacillius. I’m tasting tart lactobacillius with a sweet apricot finishz. The mouth is dry, crisp, and refreshing.","Jun 03, 2021"
La Fosse,,Illinois,4.83/5,"I had this right after having Fuzzy at the tasting room in St. Louis and they are neck and neck. I may actually prefer La Fosse, because the apricots have a more unique aroma and tartness that set it apart from Fuzzy more significantly than anticipated.","Nov 09, 2019"
La Fosse,,Ohio,3.94/5,"Slightly hazy unpolished gold with a fizzy white blanket settling to a thin spotty film.

Having this side by side with Smooth, this is more sour, sharp and sweet, and also slightly firmer of body with a crisp fizz. The oak is almost vinegary in the swallow, and oh yeah, it's acetic. Funk and oak are less present here, but there's still a complexity of oak. However, it's less wine-like and more neutral. There are hints of yellow apple, mango and biscuit, but it's just way too acidic.","Jul 26, 2019"
La Fosse,,Maryland,4.68/5,Had poured on-site at side project cellar from a 375ml bottle. Wow is it spectacular with a tart punch to the face that finishes smooth from the apricot. Very delightful mouth feel that makes this perfect for a summer day,"Apr 18, 2019"
La Fosse,,Virginia,4.42/5,"Blend #3. 

A: Pours a fizzy, light pale orange color with basically no head. 

S: Fresh apricot, moderate and well-integrated barnyard, and a bit of pepper and vanilla.

T: Apricot and earthy barnyard complement each other nicely. Light malty sweetness, lemon, and medium-light lactic sourness on a longish finish. 

M: Medium-light body and medium-high, prickly carbonation. 

O: Lots of fresh apricot flavor with well-integrated funkiness.","Dec 30, 2018"
La Fosse,,Missouri,4.45/5,"Finally got to rate this beer. B3 from bottle to glass, pours an opaque orange hue, a lot like the juice. Very fruity on the nose. The flavor profile to me is very similar to Fuzzy(I guess I should have an actual peach and apricot side by side to really know the difference), which in the end is why I am rating it the same. Beautiful beer, that I think Side Project has improved over previous batches, as the acidity levels have gone down quite significantly in my opinion.","Jul 30, 2018"
La Fosse,,Illinois,4.58/5,"poured from a 375mLm bottle into a snifter. pours a hazy orange with a thick foam head. rich apricots, oak sour acidity on the nose. taste follows with a bit of funk from the base beer. really good but really sour. medium-full mouthfeel with a dry finish. it’s really good, right up there with fuzzy, but the apricot addition makes for a sour experience for sure.","Jul 22, 2018"
La Fosse,,North Carolina,4.59/5,"L: Bold tangerine and dark orange hues with a thin wispy white head that recedes quickly
S: Ripe juicy apricot with a complement of other citrus and stone fruits and slight hay funk
T: Healthy shot of tart grapefruit followed by a burst of muddled peaches; the finish is a robust funky apricot note that lingers
F: Medium bodied with light carb; rich and jammy
O: For a four-year-old bottle of blend #1 this has held up surprisingly well. The carb and head have fallen off slightly, but what's left is a concentrated wild apricot jammy experience. Another incredible fruited sour by one of the best in the game - well done.","Jul 04, 2018"
La Fosse,,Rhode Island,4.77/5,"Batch 2 bottle poured into a Side Project wine glass. 

Pours a super pulpy, bright, glowing orange body with a frothy white head that leaves nice lacing and retention. Beautiful looking beer. 

On the nose are heavy, potent apricot aromas, like a freshly sliced apricot. Bright and fresh, grassy, hay, with a sharp acidity and citrus aromas.

Taste mirrors the nose with a sharp but not cloying punch of stone fruit sourness mingled with apricot puree and citrus. Funky and pulpy stone fruits on the follow through. A bit yeasty on the finish. Crisp, medium body with medium-low carbonation.

One of the best stone fruit sours I’ve ever had.","May 21, 2018"
La Fosse,,Iowa,4.73/5,"Blend 2, consumed onsite at Side Project. Juicy apricots with a touch of oak and the signature Side Project yeast/sourness. Looks and smells incredible...very nicely done!","Sep 20, 2017"
La Fosse,,Colorado,4.39/5,"i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy, which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour, this beer seems way more acidic to me, but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity, i really dont know. either way, this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date. pale hazy lambic looking beer, with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast. the aroma is the best part for me, woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base, it is lambic at its core it seems, but the fruit is so vibrant here, soft super ripe apricots, their absolute essence, intense and amazingly enticing. sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers, depending on how they are used, but there is no mistaking these apricots! so true to the real fruit, in its best form. the flavor is like that too, with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor (and wood) on the front end, and all the fruit showing up later on. i like the progression of flavors moving this way, the fruit lingers long in the finish, but the beer is very dry. its a step more sour than it needs to be i think, it sort of hurts the teeth like that, has an overdeveloped bacterial sting, and sits litle vinegary in the belly. still nice bretty notes about, as fruity as the apricots themselves. great carbonation and a very light body. a very special beer, and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states...

edit: just had a blend three from awhile ago now, and it was exceedingly sour, way past the point where i would want to drink even this little bottle by myself, its got a nail polish remover thing going on, and really is overly intense in that regard. i like the apricot still, and i like the flavor overall, lemony and natural, the fruit has held up well. unfortunately, this is another beer from these guys that is just way too sour at this point, they have all been trending in that direction, but its too much now. i liked it much better when it was fresh.","Apr 22, 2017"
La Fosse,,Illinois,4.58/5,"batch 2 drank at side project on 3/28/2016

this is overall a fantastic beer. this is a phenomenal showcase of an apricot fruited wild ale. it is a tad on the ""too sour"" side, but that is only if i have to nitpick this. really a beautiful beer and one I am glad to have tried. wonderful levels of oak, apricot, some other citrus notes, and acid. lovely beer","Mar 31, 2017"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Indiana,4.67/5,"Pours black, dark tan head, absolutely gorgeous BA imperial stout. The nose features the spicy peppers, cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa, and a bit of booze. Wow.

The peppers and cinnamon are forward on the taste and AMAZING, with plenty of vanilla, cocoa, and barrel notes to provide balance and a delicious flavor profile. This is truly amazing.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,California,4.5/5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours black as night. A minuscule layer of brown head appears and then flees. Tiny bubbles throughout. 

The nose is insane. Big toffee and dark fruit. Raspberries come to mind right away, but after a few minutes that fades a bit. In comes cocoa nibs, cinnamon, coconut, vanilla, and coffee. 

The taste is amazing. Coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and cinnamon are apparent. Maple syrup seems a lot stronger now. However, the cinnamon and coffee are strong. Flavors are intense.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Connecticut,4.46/5,"Good head production and decent retention. The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts.

The aroma on this is powerful and decadent. From the moment of the pour, to sitting in the glass feet away, I'm getting strong notes of chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful.

Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish.

Thick and full bodied.","Apr 25, 2021"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,South Carolina,4.63/5,"500mL bottle into a snifter
Vintage 2021

A: Pours midnight black and somewhat viscous in appearance. Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75

S: Aroma is, my god. Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine. Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75

T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel
aged. Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate. On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive. 4.75

M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. ABV is not noticeable which is impressive. Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4

O: Overall, this is quite the beer. Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully. Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5","Mar 18, 2021"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,California,4.28/5,"22 oz bomber gifted from Donald and poured into a Prairie rastal glass. 

Deep inky black with a heavy finger of dark beige head that recedes to a thick fingernail and sticks around. 

Aroma of soy sauce and bourbon barrel, some tobacco, and some milk and dark chocolates. 

Flavor brings heavy alcohol, soy sauce, dark chocolate, tobacco, bourbon barrel, and piney hops. There is some chili pepper in there as well somewhere. 

Feel is hot, burning, scathing even, and thick with a delicate creaminess that disappears as soon as the heavy carbonation comes forward. 

Overall, I was hoping my 3,000th beer would be something really special, and this one came a little short of it. I could take more sweetness and molasses overall, this was more just pine, soy sauce, and bourbon barrel. Very cutting and linear. I much prefer the original non-barrel aged version.","Feb 08, 2020"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Germany,3.45/5,"Pours pitch black in color with a bigger, bubbly dark brown head.

Inherits aromas of nacho cheese, almonds, a load of cinnamon and a good amount of oaken, alcohol soaked oak. Carries its spices in a headstrong fashion, leaning on bakers chocolate and green peppers in a very convincing way, enhanced by a gentle toffee sweetness.

Drinks initially smooth, with a late carbonation spark, featuring a surprisingly thin body, which feels inappropriate, compared to the beer‘s full swing chili-barrel hotness.

Tastes of bakers chocolate, licorice, scented wood and scorched malts from the very beginning. Its boozy barrel character unfolds among equally hot chilies in a burning and challenging fashion, unsuccesfully calmed by a prominent bitter chocolate flavor. Brings alcohol soaked, dried raisins to the palate during its finish, washing away the beer‘s balancing creaminess with a pungent, complex hotness, which gets a dry touch during its finish.

Tastes very booze forward, with an uncompromising interplay between chilies and bourbon. By developing such a hot bite, the beer misses out on its smoothness, which the regular version is able to provide.","Oct 26, 2018"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Germany,4.39/5,"Pours a pitch black coloration with a medium, creamy, dark brown head. Smells of rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon and chili peppers, with a hint of vanilla, oak and quite a hot bourbon note. Taste follows the nose, being dominated by rich, bitter chocolate, roasted malts and spicy chili peppers, with a good amount of vanilla and lighter notes of cinnamon, dark fruits: fig, raisins, some oak and a light earthiness. There's also quite a hot, boozy bourbon note to this. It starts out a little sweet, with the chocolate and vanilla standing out the most, but turns more a lot more bitter and warming in the aftertaste. Finishes with a medium bitterness, vanilla notes, and some heat, both from the chili and booze, lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a rich body and low carbonation.

This thankfully doesn't have that odd, floral chili note that normal Huna has, the chilies feeling a lot more sharp and spicy. A little less earthy and bitter as well, with more vanilla sweetness and a lot more booziness. slightly richer dark fruit notes as well. Mouthfeel is actually quite a bit worse though, not having quite that thick, almost viscous quality to it that normal Huna has. Still quite smooth though. I actually think that the heat from the chilies and the booze work together quite well to create quite an aggressive character works well with the bitterness and is balanced out nicely by a certain sweetness from the vanilla.","Oct 21, 2018"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Nevada,4/5,"Thanks to james for trading that magnum BART to score all these Cigar City beers and Hunahpu variants. Will return the favor. 

Pours black. Brown head, cola in appearance, 1/2"" deep. Retention ain't too shabby. The aroma is a hot stinging dose of alcohol first, then roasted malt, chile pepper, wet oak, cinammon. There is a lot going on in the nose, I seriously think I sniffed it 4 times in the first 60 seconds because each time it revealed more about the beer. Thankfully we cracked this one a little more leaning to the room temperature side of things. 

The taste like the aroma came through as hot on the first sip. There was also a substantial amount of bitterness, this thing seemed to be clocking in around the 90 ibu range, tons of roasted barley in here and I guess a decent degree of hopping to get it into that range. There isn't the smoothness of a vanilla factor here, and the cacao nibs similarly get swallowed up by more domineering parts of this beer. Previous iterations seemed to have more pepper heat, but I dunno, there's heat here in multiple ways, the alcohol first, then the pepper, each contributing to the overall burn and bitterness. 

Plenty of viscosity in the mouthfeel, CCB makes some thick ass stouts. Its real good, but definitely a beer you need to share, it just isn't something I can dome solo, even though I absolutely enjoy it in small quantities.","Oct 08, 2018"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Ohio,4.6/5,"Slick, viscous motor oil black with a thin, fizzy mocha blanket that settles to a thin ring.

Smell still has that classic Huna cinnamon-chili pepper combo, with chocolate syrup and roasted nuts, but there is a sweet, maple-esque bourbon presence mildly running with it, as a touch more heat burns the nostrils.

On the palate, cinnamon and chilies are mellowed out behind an almost milky yet charred oak presence that allows dark chocolate to come more forward before a more peppery, spicy bourbon emerges, that again, has a maple-like influence to it. Notes of coconut and vanilla also come through, even before it warms. It's quite a surprising improvement over an already special beer, particularly because of the less potent pepper presence.

This still has a viscous, velvety body with a crisp moderate fizz and a sticky, semi-dry finish, now featuring a more boozy, instead of peppery, burn.","Jul 19, 2018"

The smell definitely gets better as it warms with the bourbon barrel notes dominating and also the cinnamon, chile peppers, and cacao nibs that make the regular Hunahpu’s so amazing are hiding behind the barrel notes.

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Illinois,4.52/5,"750ml bottle, 2017 release, poured into a stemless wine glass. Enjoyed on 12.10.17, reviewed from Tasting Journal.

The beer pours a jet black color, crazy thick and super viscous with a thick finger of head, low retention with a few spots of lace. The aroma is nice, tons of fudge, light heat, tons of cinnamon, smooth barrel, light char, mild vanilla and a really nice rich grain aroma. The flavors are excellent, tons of cinnamon, crazy thick fudge, super rich and decadent with ample bourbon barrel offering some caramel and charred oak, a nice vanilla presence with rich grains, stone fruits and a nice hint of vanilla as well. The mouthfeel is perfect, coating, thick full body, creamy and incredibly smooth with a warm and lightly spicy finish.

Verdict: A world class rendition of Hunahpu from Cigar City. Insane depth to this beer, tons of complex flavors that super balanced and expressed so well and the mouthfeel and body really take this to new heights. Just a delicious beer.","Mar 02, 2018"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Minnesota,4.71/5,"2017 vintage. Tremendous taste and nose. Light coconut, spice, plenty of cinnamon. Not a very pronounced barrel presence, but it's there. It's surprising how excellent this is, but being a fan of the base beer, it should probably be expected.

Well done, Cigar City. I know a lot of people look past Huna these days - it's impossible to overlook BA Huna!","Feb 18, 2018"
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Oregon,4.4/5,"750ml bottle, of the 2017 release (blue El Catador label). Served in a Cigar City snifter glass. Pours a dark motor oil black body, half finger mocha head, short retention, not much in way of lacing. Big legs on this bad boy. Smell is rich bourbon and chocolate fudge; the bourbon is a smooth and slightly warming presence, oak and charred caramel. Milk chocolate, touch of cinnamon, and touch of cocoa rounds it out. It's a very smooth, well-integrated bourbon barrel on the aroma working with the base beer. Flavour is a bit muddled, however. I get a bit of milk chocolate and a touch of cinnamon up front, with a more astringent and bitter cocoa. Hunahpu's has never been a super cinnamon forward beer, and it shows here. There is mostly milk chocolate, cocoa, and a fair bit of whiskey flavour and heat. A bit of vanillin perhaps thickens up the mouthfeel on the backend some. I do notice a fair bit of extra heat on the backend, that lingers for a little bit after you've finished your sip, a bit of a sting to it. Pretty solid, and the balance is what I remember the base beer to have, except the bourbon adds on an additional dimension. The mouthfeel is heavy and thick-bodied, lower in carbonation but adequate, oily with a bit of whiskey and pepper heat on the finish. A fun beer to finally tick, even if it took until the 2017 release to do so.","Feb 09, 2018"

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,,Missouri,4.33/5,"Shared with friends at CBC Como on 1-27-18. 2017 version(blue label). Pours about as black as it gets with no real head to speak of. Great nose, with hints of cinnamon and spice predominant, and a hint of barrel. From there, I guess I was a bit let down. Having the regular version on a few occasions, I was expecting the barrel treatment to give this beer a boost. Instead, the flavors come off a little muddled.

"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",,Massachusetts,4.22/5,"A- Tallboy pours a black brew into a tulip glass. The cocoa dark brown head shoots up quickly to an inch high with a decadent foamy consistency and pretty good retention. Small sheets of lacing from a tiny ring at the edges.

S- Hershey's chocolate, mocha, lactose sweetness and roast grains are massive in the aroma and this one finds a nice balance between the dessert and the base stout beer. In the end things come down to the great combo of espresso coffee and milk chocolate, a classic combo that isn't always easy to pull off beer. This comes off as fresh mocha with no coffee ground hints. Caramel and vanilla round it all out.

T- Not quite as sharp as the aroma as the sweetness comes down a bit harder on the palate really pushing that Herhey's milk chocolate feel even further but still well executed. Caramel, molasses, lactose and fudge sweets open things up for rich espresso notes, slight dark fruits, charred bitter roast barley, toasted nuts, vanilla and marshmallow. Again, lands with a very gripping sweetness and it overshadows a lot of the other flavors compared to the harmony of the aroma.

MF- Luscious and wonderfully soft on the palate. The beer is very, very thick but the texture is chewy and downright creamy and oh so smooth. Carbonation is at a medium level and roasty bitterness lingers in the finish.

A very nice aroma of mocha and vanilla leads into a taste that approaches too sweet but thankfully never goes over that threshold. Enjoyed more than some of the other holiday time stouts from Tree House as the chocolate is held in check here and overall it finds a pretty nice balance.","Feb 02, 2020"

Review #1850

Fuller bodied, near pitch black appearance. The oily looking liquid was topped by a frothy, finger-tall, saddle brown head that fizzled away fairly quickly. A thin collar capped the beer.

Really solid aroma. In typical Tree House milk stout fashion, dry, flinty, roasted malts melded nicely with rich mocha notes. Darker roast coffee came to mind. Some powdered cocoa too. Moderately sweet. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified, and the chocolate took on a Hershey’s syrup-like quality. Some vanilla appeared as well. Bit of lactose. There was a nice coffee ice cream thing going on.

The flavor profile was similar to the aroma but less punchy. Malty up front. Nice combo of roasted and sweet caramel malts. Chocolate appeared in the center. Again, chocolate syrup came to mind. Bit of vanilla and creamy lactose too. Black coffee was noticeable on the back end. The beer finished with an interesting mix of creamed and sugared coffee and slightly bitter roastiness.

The mouthfeel was somewhat disappointing and fairly atypical for Tree House milk stout. Lighter in body than I anticipated and fairly under carbonated. This almost seemed a touch flat. After a few sips, I could feel the sugars in this leaving a slightly sticky film on my lips.

Although Tree House’s milk stouts taste pretty similar, most are quite impressive. Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known was much in the vein of the others but lacked a bit of complexity and intensity, as well as that signature Tree House pillowy soft mouthfeel. I am glad I had an opportunity to try this but probably would not seek it out again.","Jan 30, 2020"

Smell - The nose smelled of fresh sweet coffee. There was no bitterness here. 

Taste - The nose was the clue that coffee would dominate the profile. Notes of malted chocolate, maple, and toasted marshmallow follow in the profile. The underlying current of coffee continued into the aftertaste. In every sense, this is a dessert stout. 

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was low, but there was not enough viscosity to make this feel like a cake shake.

Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,,California,3.86/5,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely.

S: Almost candied citrus and melon, tropical and stone fruit, earthy, spicy herbal notes, a touch of pine, biscuity malt, and a little caramel honey sweetness.

T: Interesting mix of citrus, tropical, and stone fruit, lemon peel, melon, papaya, lime, apricot, a hint of pineapple, and faint tangerine, spicy herbal notes, fairly earthy, a touch of cedar/ pine, biscuity malt, and a little caramel honey sweetness. 

M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, yet it still sits like a silk pillow on the palate.

O: I'm not sure if I've been spoiled by really good NEIPAs out here in CA, or if I'm just not the biggest fan of Trillium's style, or both. (This is not the first time that I've had one of their highly rated beers only to be kinda disappointed.) 
The malt base is beautifully smooth, but the hops come through kinda muddied because of that spicy earthy herbal presence which, given that it's prominently mentioned in the description, is definitely intentional. I can kinda see how some people would be into this more than I am, but I think there are far better ways to add depth of flavor and let the marquis hop shine.","Jun 23, 2023"

Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,,North Carolina,4.44/5,"A: Pours an extremely hazy/murky bright golden pale orange in color with moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate bright yellow + bright orange + pale golden yellow + peach + apricot colored highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense sudsy foamy white head that reduces to a handful of small patches of thin film surrounded by a large patch of mottled very thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit + pale + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness.

T: Upfront there are light to moderate flavors of biscuit + pale + wheat malts with a light amount of sugary sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of citrus/orange zest + citrus/tangerine + tropical/pineapple + melon/cantaloupe + herbal + pine/resinous hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which fades away fairly quickly leaving moderate lingering tropical + citrus + herbal hops flavors.

M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Slightly crisp upfront with a moderate amount of soft/fluffiness mid-body and a light amount of dryness in the finish.

Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,,Netherlands,4.19/5,"Got this one from Gary and Carrie this past summer. Thanks, guys! 

From a 16oz can into a pint glass

APPEARANCE: A hazy pour yields a two finger, medium looking, frothy, slightly foamy white head with good retention. A cloudy, muddy amber orange with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a faint cap and leaves some foamy lacing on the glass. A decent wisp remains until the end leaving touches of lacing on the glass as it empties. 

SMELL: Lots of passion fruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine and lemon on the nose. Really, really bold and fruit forward. Some melon as well. Super fruity and enticing. Smells great. 

TASTE: Passion fruit, pineapple, mango, with lots of tropical flavors up front. Melon notes too. Big finish of tropical fruits, some melon and caramel sweetness, as well as some piney bitterness and a touch of alcohol linger on the palate. 

PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a burn and finishes mostly dry. A touch of bitterness lingers. 

OVERALL: Excellent stuff. The nose on this one is out of this world. It’s a bit harsh for the ABV perhaps, but other than that, there’s lots of juicy goodness here to enjoy. Thanks again for the can, guys! Appreciate you thinking of me.","Oct 23, 2019"

Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,,New Jersey,3.78/5,"Yeah, this is old as the date on the bottom of the can read 10/4/17 and yes, I have a ton of beer to get through here at my house. With that being said, I wasn't sure why this was rated so high. Maybe it's the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall, this was an average beer that didn't stand out in any particular way to me, even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time...

Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a deep apricot with enough fluffy head to top it off. Quite cloudy, only a bit of sediment floated in it and hardly any light got in around the edges. Very little soapy lacing was seen along the back of my pint glass as I worked my way through this, which was a bit of a surprise. Loads of Mosaic, dankness, grass, and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste. Nothing heavy here and the Barley stood out more than anything else in the taste, as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time. A lack of easily discernible bitterness stood out to me as this went right down and although it wasn't bad, it needed quite a bit more to stand out from Trillium's other offerings that I've had.

Not a lot of booze here either as this was the epitome of what a generic American Pale Ale is, in my eyes. I need to get a fresh can of this but given how well their other offerings have held up well over time, this one was a bit of a letdown. I prefer the regular Fort Point and know that it's me, and not them, when it comes to how low I rated this. Needs another go before I fully write it off!","Mar 21, 2019"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,,Minnesota,3.68/5,"I've been on and off with mosaic for a few years now - I'm a fan of how soft it makes a beer, and Fort Point is no exception. This beer also exemplifies the mosaic effect - it's quite green and grassy, and while that's great, I am not sure that I get the hype. The beer is quite drinkable and tasty, but it's certainly no Citra-hopping.","Jan 11, 2019"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,,Minnesota,3.6/5,"Kids! Always bring back Trillium when you visit Boston! Like you didn’t know that. 16 oz. can dated 10/4/18.

The pour is thick, phlegm-like yellow that smells like grapefruit perfume cut with pine. Not bad. 

Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point leans hard enough into grapefruit it might fall out of the car. Grapefruit for kilometers, kiwi, spring florals, touch of mint, with a nice bitter finish. Dry. Easy enough to drink, which might be its calling card. 

I can’t speak for the masses (but I will anyways), but this appears to be a classic case of “this is Trillllllium!”-itis. A good, solid beer, but nothing to rise above many others, especially with all the genuinely excellent beers in their portfolio.","Nov 10, 2018"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,,Maine,4.38/5,"Thank you Jon for hooking me up with this one!

Pint can dated 10/04/18 pink dot. Poured into a tulip at 44f

Pours a pretty hazy, rich honey golden, with a fluffy, two-finger ever-so-slightly off-white head, slowly slinking down to small patchy islands of film, and a little collar. Some spotty lacing. Absolutely beautiful color.

Nose is dank dank dank Mosaic hops. That dark fruit/berry aroma, with a big impression of passionfruit and over-ripe mango. Some Meyer lemon action in there as well. Sweet, dank, and tropical fruity. Very Mosaic.

Palate is very dank. There is a fragile malt backbone, providing just a touch of sweetness, but the hops are the star of the show here. The malt here is just enough of a platform to securely showcase the huge Mosaic dry hopping headline. Big dankness. That passionfruit is much more muted on the palate, with more of a berry/starfruit/mango vibe. It is still fruity, but the scale is tipped way in favor the dank side. A very restrained bitterness comes in towards the finish, taking this fruity dankness, and drying it out to chalky proportions. Balanced. Uber hoppy. This drinks way more like an IPA than an APA.

Mouthfeel is crisp, but medium bodied. It has some good heft to it. A lot of body for the ABV. It's soft and super juicy up front, and then the dryness comes in on the finish, drying it out very fast. Carbonation is medium and strong, and gives it a little bit of lift.

Overall, this is a fantastic pale ale. It has so much flavor. I don't think you could make this anymore flavorful. The Mosaic dry-hopping is great. The quintessential essence of Mosaic. The nose is to die for, and the feel is great. Absolute Mosaic flavor bomb. My first offering from Trillium, and I'm impressed. Scored a touch low, because I still have some killer beers to review (Galaxy Cutting Tiles) and I didn't want to over-rate myself into a corner. This is fantastic. If you love Mosaic like I do, you need this.","Oct 28, 2018"

Smell is grapefruit, herbal earthiness, lemon, tangerine and mango.

Taste follows suit, but the fruit mixed with the herbal, earthiness and bitterness seems to get muddled a little bit. It is still very good, but not as robust as the smell suggested.

Feel is light and crisp with a dry finish. There is a slight stickiness on the finish as well from the hop oils.

Overall this is a very good beer. Not my favorite version of Fort Point, but still very enjoyable.","Feb 06, 2018"
Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,,California,4.35/5,"Canned 11/15. A nice murky honey-tea color with a tall, tall poofy head of 3 fingers. Tons of gobs of lace left behind. 

Such a refreshing nose. Should be made into a summer candle. Effervescence of pear, spritzer, honey, apple, melon, and lemon float up to the nose in an ocean wave-like wafting. Ever so slight dank at the tail end of the nose. 

Flavor is juicy, although I can tell it has faded just a touch as there's some notes that I can sense the shadow of but not quite full-on. Nice pineapple, banana peel, oranges, bubble gum, starfruit, and mango all form together for a soft but easy profile. 

Feel is creamy and soft all the way, and has a nice resiny touch at the finish.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,,New Hampshire,4.17/5,"Canned on 11/15/17 Opened on 12/6/17

Pours out a rather sexy orange hued gold with yellow highlights. Hazy...practically opaque with a white, bubbly foam matter that fizzles slow. Only the slightest scattering of foam andva minimal but present ring around tge edge of the glasd remains. 

The nose is overwhelmed by dank hops....freshly crushed up whole cone hops, very earthy....wet forest on a mid july morning, herbal and spicy, hefty grains of the harvest, lightly sweet fruity notes, grandma's spice rack and a sweet, but light honey bite from the malt. Extraordinary.

This Pale Ale certainly gives many ipa's a ""run for the money"" in hop-complexity. A very freshly harvested hop flavor proves to be impressive, green, leafy veggies, mango, starfruit, pineapple juice all seem to be within the earthy and herbal dominated hop affect. Spring water and herbal malty flavor seems rather odd....herbs, veggies and hearty grains make up the pale malt flavor. Tangy wheat malt with seriously sweet and sour fruits and herbs sums it up well. A very low...almost void-of bitterness style hop edge seems just a bit strange. Thr hops seem very fresh, but also mild in the finish, perhaps an effect of tge mosaic strain being the dry hopped choice? 

Layers of flavor's from the hops happen in subtle ways, from tropical juice of starfruit and pineapple, to earthy, sour herbs. The layers are also obvious in the mouthfeel, juicy medium body, dry and peppery middle with a long, malty and juicy finish. 

Favorite aspect is the seriously fresh tasting hop complexity, with earthy and non-bitter tropucal fruit notes. A very melliw vibe with multiple layers of complexity. Odd and interesting.","Dec 06, 2017"

Heavy Mettle,,New Jersey,4.46/5,"Pours a bright and hazy yellow. A finger of soapy white head. Solid retention, some lacing. A dense haze leading to minimal light penetration. 

Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence. 

Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence. 

Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is.

Overall an enjoyable NEIPA. This one is a big boy. Juicy, sweet, and dank. I personally preferred Cutting Tiles, but there is still many Trillium IPAs to try and I look forward to future entries into this brewery.","Sep 24, 2020"

Heavy Mettle,,New Hampshire,4.68/5,"Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch.

Amesbury MA","Aug 15, 2020"
Heavy Mettle,,Maine,4.51/5,"Pint can - dated 10/11/19 - poured into an RC IPA glass at 46F.

Pours a turbid, nearly milky, delightfully glowing pale orange hue, topped with a very short head that quickly recedes to a thin film and collar. A small swirl deposits some scant lacing along the glass. 

Nose: The aroma is bursting with ripe, succulent citrus aromas - orange juice, pomello, and grapefruit - along with a big bouquet of ripe tropical and stone fruits. Lots of mango, some guava, pineapple, and a hint of papaya, with secondary notes of kiwifruit, strawberry, blueberry, coconut, lychee, peach, nectarine, and a remarkably sweet, exotic fruity element that I simply cannot place. The aroma is completely saturated, sweet, and fruity, and bears no earthy, musty, or funky components. 

Palate: The beer greets the palate with a forceful, sugary sweetness, which is to be expected from a dry-hopped beer of this calibre. It isn't a starchy, malty sweetness, but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness, like ripe tropical fruit. Speaking of ripe tropical fruit, the flavour is bursting with ripe mango, pineapple, papaya, and overripe peach, the latter being very indicative of the Galaxy hops that are crammed into this. There are some bright, juicy, slightly acidic notes of orange juice and grapefruit, which highly compliment the pineapple notes, and also help to cut through some of the sweetness. Much of this acidity is presumably hop burn, though it's restrained enough to be enjoyable, adding a layer of complexity rather than being detrimental to the beer itself. There is just a touch of earthy dankness which is also to be expected from a bill containing any amount of Galaxy. I suspect the grist contains a measurable amount of oat, as the malt is clean, fairly neutral, and possesses practically zero graininess. The finish is quite fruity and floral, before the sweetness gently subsides, allowing just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end, before lifting off, leaving a clean, oaty dryness and a whisper of peach lingering.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's a big, bold, dry hopped New England double IPA clocking in at 9.3% ABV, AND it's from Trillium. Anyone who has had a big Trillium IPA can imaging that this beer is just one massively fluffy hoppy pillow. The beer is soft, fluffy, creamy, and velvety smooth, yet still possesses enough effervescence to lend texture and cut through some of the heft. Nevertheless, this is a very stout beer, and is by no means a midday summer refresher. While the flavour profile would allow this to pair nicely with food, I think the sheer weight of it may prevent it from being the ideal mean accompaniment. Also bear in mind that aside from the heft of this beer, it shows little-to-no evidence of it's ABV, which could make this a dangerous little creeper.

Overall: For what this beer is, it's hard to find much, if anything wrong with it. It's a wonderfully fruity, sweet, succulent double (verging on triple) IPA crafted with the trademark uniqueness that has made Trillium a cult classic. It embodies everything the brewery is known for, from its top-tier hops, to the pillowy mouthfeel, all packed into a whopper of a beer, that's easy and enjoyable to drink. A true hoppy cornerstone of the Trillium lineup.","Nov 19, 2019"

Heavy Mettle,,New Jersey,4/5,"Traded for this a while ago, as the date on the bottom of the can read 1/15/17 with ""EW-WAM-AM-AH"" written below that. I don't know what that means or if that is a heavy metal reference but I can honesty say that this was a typical Trillium beer that had all of their attributes present in it, including an easy sense of enjoyment to it throughout my session!

Not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted honey with enough off to offset the the cloudy, dull liquid even though that settled relatively quickly. Only a few spots of lacing was left behind as I worked my way through this as the residue on the side of my pint glass was quite disappointing. Tons of mango, citrus rind, booze, and yeast filled the nose although they were quite muted from the first whiff onward. Dank, pithy, and strong, tons of melon, cantaloupe, and kiwi came through as this warmed up but it was never easygoing enough for me to fully embrace. This had a creaminess and slickness to it that saved it from being a disappointment but it needed more sugar and tangerine from feeling too heavy, as the carbonation was nearly nowhere to be found...

No doubt that this had enough alcohol to it and it seemed to complement the subtle hop burn quite well. That wasn't what I was looking for as this beer put the ""heavy"" into heavy mettle. Tons of Galaxy hops ensured that this would be a dank hop bomb but in the end, this needed it's rough edges rounded out a bit.

what a disappointment ... a formerly magical and uniquely flavorful beer is now a heavy, overly sweet and muddled mess

Look is dark.. pour yields very little head, a small ring remains

Smell : surprisingly muted , very little tropical or juicy characteristic.. I almost get a rotten citrus smell 

Taste- at once sticky sweet (which this beer never was before, despite its high abv) and bitter . With this hop combo I expect that classic trillium magic (and I could allow for a bit of hop burn), but this is just sharp, bitter and unpleasant to drink. No single fruit characteristic comes to mind- it feels like a huge mouthful of extra sweet jolly ranchers mixed with garlic cloves .. it tastes thick, chewy and muddled— galaxy and Columbus hops flavors are completely buried

Feel: harsh, mouth-coating unpleasantness ; surprisingly thin for such a high abv.

IF this is a result of the new fermentation profile, this is a major disappointment and has confirmed that trilliums beers are no longer for me.

Pours a massively murky glass of OJ with a scant finger of soft, creamy head. Retention is no better than so-so, leaving a pretty, creamy collar and a thin curtain of lacing.

Robust nose of pineapple, weed and sexy, sweaty girl.

Taste is massively dank and weedy, sort of a cross between ditchwater and bhang water. Wow. Give me a second here. OK. Super-juicy with overripe pineapple, orange rind, sweet, sticky, dripping peach, composty melon, guava, lime and macerated ditch weeds steeped in sexy sweat. A little composted-melon-rind-sour-booziness lingers on the palate and in the sinuses at the finish.

Feel is thick and juicy, verging on sticky/syrupy, medium-hefty bodied and well carbonated. Drinks like a mixed-drink cocktail like they might serve you at brunch with a bamboo umbrella and a maraschino cherry.

Whew. I've had Heavy Mettle a couple times before, maybe not since Canton opened? and somehow managed not to review it but is this the original recipe?

Slight cheese, assertively but appropriately acidic - on the fruit front, granny smith apple, bit of lemon flesh, some white peach. Some chardonnay grape as well. Great mix of bright fruit and complex, earthy funk

T: great swallow, delivers a nice mix of fruit and sour with bright acidity. Slight pucker at first with notes of green apple, bright and pronounced citrus. That lemon flesh character from the nose comes through well here, pleasantly sharp and leads into the medium-long finish. That more cheesy barnyard funk is more toward the finish, leaves this great lingering note with a rustic baked bread flavor as well. Flavor dances nicely in that unique way, really nice

F: medium- body, medium+ carbonation. Nicely drying, that bit of tart that suggests a nice sip

O: wonderful and tasty geuze. Bright acidity and pleasant, complex funk; solid fruit character, big fan","Jan 01, 2022"

Consumed 12/30/21

So excited to finally try this bottle that I got in a trade from Belgium. We're finally seeing a bit more 3 Fonteinen in Chicago with them dropping Intense Red and Homage in mass recently. It's a very pretty lambic. A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me. The feel is superb with the carbonation and dry finish. Overall I don't know if it's my favorite 3F, but it's up there. Worth picking up a 2nd one if you can get 2.","Dec 30, 2021"

Corona Day #10

Price: $59.99 at Healthy Spirits 15th Street in San Francisco

Appearance: 5 - a glowing apricot orange. Thick bubbly head for days.

Nose: 4 - yeah, it's a Gueuze for better or worse. For some reason I always get a briny kind of smell on these, like vinegar or pickles. Here's one: you know what your piss smells like after you have asparagus? This.

Taste: 4 - not as good as the Cuvee Armand & Gaston, which is my favorite Gueuze. Hefty vinegar / pickles here. Intensely flavored, though. Action packed.

Mouth: 5 - tremendous. Extremely effervescent. The sourness and acidity make my mouth water even though it's already wet. Impressive. That was a pretty great description, so I copied / pasted from the Hommage review.

Overall: 4 - an excellent example of the style, and one I'm glad I got to try. Wish I had gone to the other store that had the half size for half price, but hey, you only live once.

Oude Geuze Golden Blend,,Minnesota,4.5/5,"Season 16|17 Blend No. 51 - drank November 2nd, 2019 while cleaning out a few bottles of lambic. What truly stands out to me about this blend is that it's quite absent the typical apples that define many geuzes - the tart and sour notes are far more present, and the beer doesn't have quite the same body. Lots of oak notes dominate as well. It's funky, but only lightly so.

Quite a terrific beer. I'm not sure that I'd rate it significantly superior to Drie Fonteinen's standard Oude Geuze though (that being said, I absolutely adore the standard geuze... it amazes me that it's a shelfie in certain parts of the country).","Feb 24, 2020"
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,,Germany,4.9/5,"Pours a clear, deep golden amber coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smell is dominated by quite rich, musty, blue cheese funk and tart and fruity yeast esters of green apple, pear and gooseberry, as well as some lemongrass, hay and musty oak. Taste is a superb balance of quite rich and nuanced musty, moldy, cheesy funk, expressive, tart, fruity and slightly spicy yeast esters of green apple, pear, apricot, white grape, gooseberry, lemongrass, clove and white pepper as well as a distinct earthy, musty oak presence and lighter notes of hay, white vinegar and sulphur. Finishes with a medium tartness and some rich funky and estery notes lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth, effervescent mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium/strong carbonation.

What really stands out here is the rich, complex and quite nuanced funkiness that ranges from sweaty, musty notes to moldy blue cheese and mushrooms, being backed up and balanced by an assertive, but not overpowering lactic acidity and tart, estery fruit, with quite an array of fruity notes and lighter spicy accents as well as a not too heavy, but distinct earthy, musty oak presence, making for a quite a rich, complex, yet superbly balanced Geuze, with no aspect of the flavor profile feeling overpowering while still mainting a tremenduous depth of flavor.

S: Aromatic and tart berries and cherries up front and center. With an unmistakable earthy funk. There is a bit of oak and vanilla here as well. A really pungent and sharp aroma that I enjoy.
T: Oh boy, that sweet tart berry/cherry mix is there. Which becomes super acidic and sour. That funk, light oak and vanilla is there as well. Which tries to help balance. Though that acidic sourness becomes a little to much and makes this unbalanced for me.
M/O: A medium body that has a nice crisp bite. Really well carbonated. Definitely some sweetness as would be expected, but finishes with a dry bite as well. Pretty classic for the style, but still its slow going. That acidity takes over to much.

I love 3 Fonteinen, and this is a good example of the style for sure. Though it is unbalanced for me. There are other Fruit Lambic's that I prefer over this, but still you have to acknowledge that this is exactly what they wanted to make, and I do enjoy it.

Aroma is quite fantastic, a combination of raspberry jam with the slight mustiness of a kriek. It's got jammy raspberry with some overt tartness. There's also an underpinning of chamomile. They say don't meet your heroes and often times with beer, it feels like you are set up for disappointment when you have a highly sought after and/or highly regarded beer. This is a true icon of the lambic game and rightfully so.","Jul 30, 2022"

Hommage,,Connecticut,4.61/5,"Two year old bottle.

Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still.

Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket.""

The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish.

Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however.

This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age.","Jan 17, 2022"

The nose is raspberry, cherry, lemon, and vinegar.

The taste opens with medium-sour lemon, vinegar, and green olive and finishes with raspberry and cherry. Very low sweetness and medium tartness. The initial pop of vinegar and green olive is somewhat off-putting, but the beer becomes more balanced and fruity as it warms and my palate adjusts.

The mouthfeel is medium for the style. Puckering tartness with a clean finish.

Cloudy cinnabar body supports a thin layer of very pale pink foam which dissipates to a vague collar pretty rapidly; poor retention, no legs. 

Intensely, flamboyantly aromatic - suffused with bright berry, cherry, and fine aged red wine vinegar notes. Wild and complex.

Bracing acidity, with pepper and mild cheese notes quickly overwhelmed by tart fruit. Perfectly blended lambic with nuts, peppercorn, wildflower, honey, and foraged greens emerging occasionally beneath the raspberry and barnyard notes. Some minerality but not too many tannins in the finish, which while dry, isn't puckering. 

Milky, smooth mouth-feel - could do with a tiny bit more carbonation perhaps, but it isn't bad for the style.

Pours a nice ruby red color, translucent with a small white tan head is fizzy and dissipates quickly. Aroma is huge sourness, tart lactic acidity, with a prominent minerality and plastic like funk notes. Tons of fruit notes as well with huge raspberry, nearly as big cherry, and even some strawberry notes (although I know there’s no strawberries in it). Just an absolutely wonderful aroma. Taste is just an insanely huge puckering sourness. This is easily amongst the most sour beers I’ve ever had and I love that. Fruit notes balance wonderfully with both sour and sweet and raspberry and cherry. Some clean mineral drying characters, moderate oakiness, essentially no pungeant funk notes but rather all sour/tart characters; which again I love. Carbonation is actually quite low, I think it’s fair to say undercarbed, although the puckering tartness and drying finish make that low carbonation affect the product less than it otherwise would. Drinkability is excellent and I wish I had more of this. Overall just a wonderful beer.

Look: The beer pours pinkish / light red from the bottle. In the glass it’s translucent cranberry juice / raspberry tea color. An ever so slight haze to it. Lots of carbonation. Light pink head disappears with no lacing.

Smell: The fruit is sweet, tart and acidic. Sweet and sugary cherries and raspberries and tart, fresh berries. Then the funk. Plastic-y and band aid notes are most prominent. There’s a faint barnyard manure note. Some bitter and herbal earthiness. The fruit and funk come together as a little cinnamon spice. Really nice nose. Complex.

Taste: Tart, acidic and dry. Sometimes the fruit jam sweetness comes through on these beers, but not here. The acidity is manageable and pleasant. Barely hits the jowels and never really goes full lemon juice / vinegar like some sour beers do. There’s a very slight bitterness but sour and faint sweetness are the main flavors here. What I’ll call a musty note that pops fresh and seems to subside as the beer warms. I find it difficult to exactly describe this flavor in lambic. It leans toward the plastic-y note mentioned earlier, but it doesn’t quite go that far. It’s more musty and earthy. I wish I could find a single word to describe the flavor, but I can’t really find anything yet.

Heavy body yet airy; tart and acidic balanced with cherry sweetness.

If you want something different, this is a beer to try! It is very much a fruit-forward lambic, highlighting sour cherries but also using raspberries (per the bottle label). The blending of this beer is truly artful, the result being a stupendous and lovely beer.

Nearly clear Arylide yellow body with a steady stream of micro-bubbles. Off white cap disappears rapidly. Almost no lacing, nor legs. 

Subtle complex yeast-driven aromatics suffused with poolish, fresh cut hay, and stone fruit. Floral, with a whisper of white wine/champagne. 

Bright with a balance of light grain/malt, tart meyer lemon/unripe pear, and a faint peppery/barnyard edge from the Brett. Light clean bitterness with a touch of alfalfa and clover. Long, medium-dry finish reveals full maturation and synergy of ingredients. 

A bit thin and fizzy with lingering acidity. What meager roundness is present seems almost (but not quite) chalky. 

Excellent aroma and flavor, a core expression from the brewery, but the body is more like a lambic than a saison - perhaps this was not a great bottle/batch, but at the price point I'm not eager to roll the dice again right away.","Dec 28, 2022"

Pours a slightly foggy golden straw body featuring a calm effervescence and topped with multiple fingers of tight, creamy, and soapy white foam; good head retention leaves a small layer of fluffy cap along with a persistent collar and comprehensive walling of moderate soapy lacing.

Aroma offers a tight, spritzy yeast coursing with tempered lemony funk and a soft bubblegum/clove undertone to open; fresh apricot zest, touches of soft spice and honey, and sweet overripe peach flow into a maintaining clove background; horse blanket, minerality and fresh, herbal earth come to play steadily, integrating effortlessly into to the bouquet over time.

Taste showcases a raw medley of stone fruit upfront, highlighting apricot and overripe peach guiding into zesty lemon peel as a creeping acidity encroaches across the profile with a minor funk/horse blanket interlude and bright, floral minerality lasting through the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a light body with a well-attenuated and fluffy high carbonation easing to a blanket of gritty spritz across the mid-palate with a quaint, casual acidity/ tartness building; a background wetness persists on the back end before being overtaken by a taut, dry finish as a soft acidity lasts through the swallow.

Simultaneously contemplative and casual, such clean refinement gives way to myriad accentuated detail honed with stunningly interwoven complexities along the profile and palate; a definitive example of the style, highlighting the brilliant levels of expression capable from an equally soft, elegant foundation.","May 03, 2020"
Saison Bernice,,Massachusetts,4.71/5,"First pour from the 750ml bottle is clear golden yellow with bubbling effervescence and a nice foamy white head even after several years aging in the bottle. Further pours produce a hazy cloudy appearance. The aroma is clean with light banana, hay, straw, honey, lemon, apricot, apple, pear, vanilla, doughy bready malt, some barnyard funk, horse blanket, hints of clove spice, peppercorn, apple cider, and floral earthy hops. Tastes tart, slightly sour and vinegary with apple cider notes, lemon, apricot, apple, pear, banana, hay, straw, honey, vanilla, clove, peppercorn medley, horse blanket, barnyardy funk, bready doughy malt, and floral earthy hops.

Saison Bernice,,Maine,4.41/5,"Huge thanks to Steve for this one. This has been on my radar for quite some time. 

750ml bottle (vintage??) Poured into a classic tulip. Refrigerated for 5 days - allowed to warm up for 10 minutes. 

Pours a brilliant honey straw golden colour, topped with a quick-to-dissipate finger of off white head. Excellent unfiltered clarity, and plenty of visible effervescence rising up to creating a sparkling top. Minimal lacing after swirling. 

Nose: Rustic saison grains, likely a good amount of wheat. Crackery. Plenty of classic saison yeast aromas of wet hay, peppery spice, green apple, a faint hint of bubblegum, a whisper of clove, some woody spices, fresh cut grass, wet wool, petrichor, some delicate farmy funk, a hint of leather, and a wonderfully restrained acidity lending a big shroud of lemon. A beautiful saison aroma. 

Palate: Bernice greets the palate with what is likely the most balanced acidity I've ever encountered. This is not a ""Midwest saison"" that makes you pucker up from top to bottom. A gentle tartness akin to unripe berries starts things off, while this delicate grainy sweetness follows. Beneath this sweet-tart balance are notes of lemon, apple, Bartlett pear, fresh grass, white grape, unripe berry, starfruit, fresh nectarine, white plum, a hint of phenolic black peppercorn, and dried orange peel. There is quite a bit of dusty brett, lending some light funk, wet wood, a gentle earthiness, fermenting stone fruit, and a gentle peach pit bitterness. There are subtle grassy floral notes from some very restrained hopping, which is greatly appreciated. The finish puts particular emphasis on these grassy floral notes, along with some dusty brett funk, and a gentle black pepper bite. The ale finishes beautifully dry, with zero lingering tartness, and a gentle, clean aftertaste of cracker saison grains, with the faintest whisper of tannic fruit pits. 

Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-light bodied. Crisp, refreshing, and ultra snappy with the malt providing just enough body to provide a subtle softness. Effervescence is lively and fine, without being scratchy or seltzery. Gentle acidity upfront providing a balanced tartness, concluding with just the perfect degree of tannic dryness. Highly attenuated. 

Overall: This is maybe the perfect all-around saison. It is absolutely authentic and beautifully classic in nature, with the most balanced amount of acidity you could possibly get in an ale like this. Not puckering, but enough to just nudge this into sour ale territory. This is everything you could ask for in a saison. Authenticity, perfect grain balance, gentle tartness, excellent yeast complexity, Belgian influence, crisp, refreshing body... It's wonderful. You won't find the complexity of the heavy hitter sours in this, but if it's the perfect saison you're looking for, Bernice will take you there. Privileged to be able to drink this.","Feb 18, 2020"
Saison Bernice,,Vermont,4.69/5,"I thought this beer was fantastic.

Saison Bernice,,Washington,4.23/5,"Much thanks to John for sending me on my way with this in tow. I can't find any date info on the bottle itself, but I want to say he told me it was a 2016? I could well be making that up, but that's the year that sticks in my mind for whatever reason. It's somewhere between batch 5 and 15 as best as I can sleuth up. Yeah, narrows it down a lot...

An aggressive pour gives me a golden yellow bauble that still has some opacity to it. A nice finger of white fuzzy head is dissipating in front of my eyes, but leaves at least some residual to appreciate. 

Nose is sweet with belgian yeasts, fairly peppery, and some faint lemon and green apple. Has that character to it that tickles the back of my throat when sniffing around. 

Flavour is a nice melange of lemon and pepper (but less than the nose suggested) and green apple and like undertones of marzipan, with some of the belgian sweetness towards the end, but not too much. Mildly grassy/floral and a surprisingly bitter/dry finish.","Oct 25, 2019"
Saison Bernice,,South Carolina,4.78/5,"Appearance - pours super clear golden color with a nice fluffy white head great retention. Few spotty sheets of lacing.

Aroma - Lemon, light floral, yeast, light cracker, light spiciness very delicate nose.

Feel - Soft, nice carbonation prickly at first. great dry finish.

Overall - Really well done soft flavors are very subtle.","Sep 07, 2019"
Saison Bernice,,Thailand,4.39/5,"Straw and slightly hazy with a few small, slow rising bubbles and 4 fingers of white head.

Smells of brett and funk, oranges, lemons and Belgian yeasts, some fresh plastic like a German Heffe. 

Light and subtly sour with lemons, orange rind and Brett, barrel funk, and nail polish. 

Light and crisp, tart body with a smooth carbonation. Goes down really easy.

Saison Bernice,,Massachusetts,4.39/5,"As a New Englander who has been to Vermont several times...I can't help but make the comparison (which I feel is apt) to Hill Farmstead's lovely array of farmhouse ales.

Simultaneously simple yet complex - Bernice comes through across all four sensory components with high marks. She pours slightly cloudy, yellow liquid that sits beneath a cap of white foam. Light, but lively, effervescence brings the beer to life.

Aroma is citrus, hay and light funk. Balanced harmony with each playing to the others' strengths. Restrained but remarkable. Taste is citrus - apricot, lemon and grapes - followed by a tart and funky kiss. Fruity and earthy yeast-notes throughout. 

Tart, refreshing, appropriately acidic and lightly funky. Delicious.","Feb 11, 2019"

Saison Bernice,,Utah,4.43/5,"Poured a bright hazy yellow color with a fragile foamy white head that disappeared quickly. There were extravagant aromas of Brett, white grapes, subtle citrus, with yeasty overtones. Very fruity and aromatic. The flavors are likewise the same, very fruity with yeasty overtones. Plenty of white grapes around the mouth with some Brett and subtle citrus and perhaps pitted fruit. The flavors come without any restraint. Its like opening up this bottle released its potency. The mouthfeel was not harsh, it was quit pleasant, smooth, and light bodied. Overall exceptional beer, the flavors where spot on, again extravagant without being overwhelming. I could drink this again and again if I only I had easy access to this beer.","Nov 04, 2018"
Saison Bernice,,Nevada,4/5,"Holy crap is this rated high, I had no idea. Well its time then. Pours a cloudy yellow with 1/2"" white head. This review is from a sample on tap at the Bistro barrel aged festival. Dry yeast brett nose to it. Light. When you talk rustic agricultural stuff, here it is, plenty of leather meets wood meets hay meets various barnyard effects here. This is what its all about. Layers of aromas. 

The taste is pretty nice, you get about a 6 on the 1-10 sour scale, soft acidity, still plenty of those hay, leather, cotton, humidity and barnyard notes. Its like a blend of a saison, but the sourness of a wild ale. Light amount of pepper in the mouth feel, along with all that other stuff. Carbonation is more than average. 

I really enjoyed the beer, but wow, I think if you put an InBev label on this, it wouldn't even move the needle for beer nerds. Instead, low yield small batches from a slightly out of the way brewery = ratings gold (on BA). I totally dug it, but it didn't even stand out that day amongst all the other beers.","Sep 11, 2018"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,South Carolina,4.32/5,"12 oz bottle with a 26 October 2020 bottling date stamped on the back label. 

Near black body with a thin, semi-durable beige head. A thin dark reddish-brown edge is visible with back lighting. This smells quite sweet, I assume from the bourbon and maple syrup. It has a lightly sweet taste with a laudably balanced mix of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee. Not surprisingly, maple syrup notes are faint. Relatively thick and very smooth body. Well hidden ABV. 
Overall. The dessert version of KBS.","Jul 13, 2023"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Michigan,4.47/5,"Poured stout black and was topped by a dense brown head of 1” in height with lots of lacing down the snifter.
The aroma was strong, so strong even my Covid affected nose caught a wiff of the chocolate and bourbon.
The taste was very well balanced for so much chocolate, and rich chocolate at that. It was the star of the show but the supporting cast of coffee and dark fruits and bourbon were not lost but very present.
The feel is darned near ideal for the genre, just a tiny bit less “chewy” or viscous than expected.
Good beer, if they brew it again I would drink it fresh instead of cellaring it for 3 years. But even then it is very good.","Jul 09, 2023"

Aroma of chocolate notes with some fudge notes and vanilla and bourbon notes are also perceptible. Taste is a mix of chocolate/fudge with some maple notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes also clearly identifiable. Body is pretty full with good carbonation and light warming alcohol notes.

KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Colorado,4.18/5,"A bottle dated 08/09/22 refrigerated since purchasing in November of the same year. Poured in a KBS snifter for the review. 

A vigorous pour produces a dark brown liquid churning up a small finger of tan foam. It settles very quickly to a ring around the glass. The smell is dominated by what else? Mackinac fudge. A slight whiff of dark roast coffee. I'm not getting anything else. The taste is very much like the smell. Pure fudge followed by dark roast coffee. A bit ashy tasting in the finish but nothing that detracts from the experience. The feel is medium bodied, rich and smooth. 

In all it's pretty typical KBS in that the barrel is invisible. Ditto for any maple in my opinion. I've always been a fan of KBS and appreciate it's simple goodness. This one is worth your time and the price was right at $21/4 pack.","Mar 02, 2023"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,North Carolina,4.49/5,"Appearance: Pours a Mackinac Fudge color (and I was there a long time ago) with a one finger tan head that fades to a bubbly collar; leggy with spots of lacing trickling down

Smell: Chocolate, maple and Bourbon with a hint of roasted coffee

Taste: Maple Bourbon Pecan fudge from Murdick's (work with me here, as I know pecans aren't a part of the recipe) but I feel that all of that is in the flavor profile; the coffee takes a back seat but, after the Bourbon builds and recedes, the roasted coffee emerges in the finish

Mouthfeel: Full bodied and silky smooth; moderate carbonation

Overall: Murdick's (and Kilwin's, too) would be happy with this tip of the hat to their craftsmanship; unlike original KBS it is more of a dessert sipper than a breakfast stout but it is still quite enjoyable","Feb 26, 2023"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Wisconsin,4.12/5,"Appearance: Pours a completely black, dark color with a strong tan head. SRM of 24. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of chocolate, coffee, dark chocolate and rich fudge. (4.50)

Flavor: Strong flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. English chocolate and malt, then some coffee roast and bitterness. Only lasts for half of a second before the sweet wave of rich malt comes forth bringing chocolate fudge, vanilla, caramel, and sweet bourbon booze. Some bitterness lingers, but ultimately sweet. (4.00) 

Feel: Heavier-bodied, strong carbonation. Bittersweet and roasted, but ultimately sweet. (4.00) 

Overall: This one drinks with lots of fudge, chocolate, and bourbon booze sweetness. The aromas here are excellent. A decent amount of bittersweet here, but ultimately drinks sweet. The maple syrup doesn't provide much flavor, but provides the sweetness. The flavors here are nice. The sweetness is intense as expected. I think it would drink even better without the maple syrup and tone the ABV down a bit, but just my preference. Glad to finally try this one. (Rating: 4.12)","Jan 23, 2023"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Pennsylvania,4.34/5,"12 oz bottle
Bottled On Date: 08.09.2022
Consumed on: 22 Januar, 2023
Glass: Snifter
ABV: 11%
Serving Temp: room temp


Look: 
Opaque black with a 2+ finger creamy dark khaki to light brown head (in a snifter!). The head is very slow to dissipate and leaves excellent lacing as it does.

Smell: 
Lots of chocolate fudge and semi-sweet chocolate with some underlying coffee notes. If one tries, very faint scents of the barrel, vanilla, and maple can be picked up. But one has to really try.

Taste: 
Intense and rich chocolate fudge and semi-sweet chocolate start things off and dominate the sip. Some maple notes show up mid-sip but they are not overly prevalent. As in the aroma, bourbon and vanilla notes are here but are quite faint. Understated notes of coffee and bittersweet chocolate appear later in the sip and stay through the finish. The alcohol is well hidden.

Feel: 
Smooth, silky and mouth-coating. A noticeable warmth from the alcohol. The body is a thin shade heavier than medium.

Overall: 
A excellently done flavored Imperial Stout as one can pretty much expect from Founders. Quite nice on cold rainy night. This is pretty much a dessert beer and is a bit too sweet for me to make it a habit, but it will make a good changeup now and again in my winter rotation.","Jan 22, 2023"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Ohio,4.4/5,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint glass.

Appearance: Very dark brown — approaching black — with a 3/4” tan head that lingered long, and left some lacing.

Nose: Strong roast, maple syrup, chocolate

Mouthfeel: Medium.

Attack: Follows the nose, though appropriately not quite as sweet, though sweetens more as it warms; adequate carbonation. Coffee.

Finish: Moves to bitterness mostly from the roast, balancing the attack nicely.

The maple fudge is more in the nose than the taste. Not quite my favorite, but another very good edition in this KBS series. Founders knows how to do quality stouts.","Jan 15, 2023"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Florida,4.36/5,"Exceptional beer from a great brewer. I found this to be not only well balanced, but truly, the booze is well hidden to the nose and mouth, not a small feat.

Deep opaque black. Very light off white head.

Smells like the fudge brownie m&m's. The aroma just makes me smile!

And for the taste! The flavor is rich, rich, rich, sweet, sweet, sweet...almost too sweet. Definite sweet cocoa, coconut, maple, vanilla, bourbon and COFFEE. It's all the flavors and sweetness rolled into one delicious pour.

KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,New Hampshire,4.54/5,"From bottle marked BOTTLED ON 08.09.22 0709 6

Pours into my tulip glass a fully opaque viscous black with a creamy bubbly taupe brown head. Head slowly receds to a ring leaving some fluffy lace as it goes.

Scent is intense fudge. Cocoa. 

Taste is rich thick fudge. Awesome. Maple shows up in the very long finish but is much quieter than the fudge notes. Some cold espresso and roasted notes appear. Cream. Vanilla. Some bitter cocoa notes.

Mouth is full, velvety and voluptuous.

I've never met a Breakfast Stout I didn't love and this one is no exception. The vivid and almost absurdly rich fudge notes - both flavor and scent - leave quite an impression but are balanced by bitter cocoa, roast and espresso which prevent the beer from being too sweet or overwhelming. The one downside is I do not detect the bourbon notes present in some of its brethren (KBS, CBS) but the fudge makes up for that. Fantastic stout.","Dec 23, 2022"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,,4.65/5,"Look: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - black pour with 3 fingers length of lacing. Some head left behind as the foam dissolves into liquid form. 
S: Getting notes of bakers chocolate/fudgy chocolate, coffee, maple, similar to sweet caramel. The bourbon is very well hidden in the smell.
T: Sweet fudgy chocolate upfront with some slight maple in the middle followed by a coffee taste in the end. Very simple review but the flavors really pop well. What I like the most is that it's a balance between all except the maple. But I have a feeling the maple enhances the flavors of the chocolate to make it sweeter/ more fudgy then normal.
F: Medium bodied - easy to drink. ABV for this hides well with the flavors of the beer. The flavors pop so much in this that I really don't mind the body.
O: I really enjoyed this beer! This was my second review - which I decided to review room temperature to get the notes better in the beer and it really does taste as amazing as it sounds. This by far is the best KBS variant for me and will be buying many more in the future. Must try.","Dec 13, 2022"

Taste is sweetened coffee, chocolate, fudge, a nice kiss of maple and vanilla - notes of the bourbon barrel - smooth with minimal bitterness.
Silky smooth full mouthfeel - rich and sweet with nice carbonation - never cloying. Just a hint of boozy heat. Fantastic variant!!!","Dec 10, 2022"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,Connecticut,4.06/5,"A few red tinges to the deep brown on the pour, but the red goes away once in the glass. Very thin head that quickly receded to a spotty cap. Aroma has plenty of maple, but what I'm most reminded of are brownies. Overall, the nose is certainly rich, but I would have preferred a little more roast to balance things out. 

Thankfully, the taste does exactly what the nose doesn't. Really nice blend of barrel, roasted malts, faint coffee, and some maple syrup on the finish. Amazingly little heat. There's some alcohol warming once it hits the stomach, but on the tongue, this is smooth and does not feel like an 11% beer.

It is a gorgeous looking dark brown to jet black color underneath a lingering, lacing-leaving tan head. 

The aroma is so sweet with its roasted dark caramel malts, chocolate fudge, milk chocolate, cream, ash, and a background of earthy hops. Basically no booze for a barrel-aged.

The mouthfeel is medium to full and creamy. Just bold.

The taste is alive of sweet dark malts and chocolate with a lower profile coffee character. Maybe too sweet for my liking. Warming. The booze is still buried but it permeates my head for sure.","Nov 06, 2022"
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,,New Hampshire,4.33/5,"From a single 12oz bottle picked up recently, at about $6.25, if I recall....

Pours black as midnight at the North Pole in December.... a black hole. Has a lovely, creamy, mocha-hued head sitting at about 1"", though it ebbed rapidly to a thin, fine, covering layer. Lacing left behind is lovely. The aroma can be picked up at least a foot away, with lots of rich chocolate fudge, coffee, maple and cocoa. Whoa! Body is a solid medium-plus, with a great, silky smooth feel on the tongue.

Flavor has loads of malty, rich goodness!. It's semi-sweet without being cloying. Has more of the fudge, coffee, maple mix noted in the aroma. Has a bit of vanilla along with toffee, plus some bourbon action lingering just beneath the surface. The finish is nice, with some subtle, earthy hop notes in the mix.

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki head that has great retention, leaving some lacing behind

S- classic KBS aroma, charred malt, bold earthy espresso and oaky bourbon barrel. A bold maple note, reminiscent of CBS arrises, followed by notes of chocolate fudge, molasses, brown sugar, anise, vanilla cream and toffee

T- sweet and malty with the fudge notes taking center stage; it literally tastes just like chocolate fudge, with some vanilla icing undertones. Mid-palate brings out bold herbal and earthy espresso, followed by a maple note that continues the sweetness. Oaky bourbon gives some barrel juice, along with toffee and caramel. The finish gives more sweet chocolate fudge, along with coffee and bourbon. Lingers of maple sweetness 

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky, slightly warming finish

L: jet black, tan cola half finger head that goes away after a minute.

S: decadent chocolate, a hint of caramel/toffee/hazelnut, a hint of ethyl that mellows as it warms, as well as a little maple syrup. Not quite like walking into a fudge shop but surprisingly close.

T: a lot of decadent bittersweet chocolate with even more character from the barrels. Finishes with a zing of those caramel/maple syrup type flavors.

F: medium body, smooth, coats the tongue, mild carbonation. Would prefer it to be a bit thicker but it’s good.

O: not fudge in a bottle but I like that, it’s a stout first and fudge flavored second. It’s a bittersweet desert sipper that you’ll only want one of due to its richness and price. Definitely feels like it’s missing something but overall a high end stout.","Oct 25, 2022"

Finale dove il cocco timidamente si riaffaccia accompagnato da un rubusto ed elegante abbraccio di bourbon. Corpo medio pieno molto vellutato con bassa carbonade.","Nov 11, 2021"
Coconut B-Bomb,,New York,4.41/5,"A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dense dark tan head that left a wide collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Moderate aromas of chocolate and vanilla-like oak are present in the nose along with notes of toasted coconut.
T: The taste has lots of flavors of bourbon and associated vanilla along with notes of chocolate and toasted coconut. The alcohol is very well hidden from the taste.
M: It feels full-bodied and very smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The alcohol lends some warming to the finish.
O: This beer does a very good job at blending the flavors together as no one flavor overpowers the others. It is also rather drinkable considering its strength.

Amazing stuff.
Very dark brown with a one finger beige head quickly fading away.
Coconut is very nicely present alongside the barrel notes of vanilla and reinforcing the notes of coconuts. 
It's about toffee and cocoa. 
Overall it's very balanced. 
The mouthfeel is not thin but not too thick either, preventing this to be a cloying beverage.

Coconut B-Bomb,,Oregon,4.09/5,"For a stout, I think pitch black. For a ""winter ale"", I think brick red. This one clearly looks like a stout. Which is ok, it just doesn't look like I'd thought it hoped for. Still, the obsidian body is beautiful, the khaki foam above is minimal, and it has a swagger about it coating the glass with each swirl. 

The aroma also leans more on the stout side if the fence, but that just may be our accustomed nature as of late to associating boozy barrel to big stouts. Their is, however, plenty of toasted bread and burnt brown sugar to defend the winter warmer namesake. The coconut would be completely overlooked, or I guess I should say unnoticed if it weren't for the advertisement on the bottle.

Similarly, this continues the theme of stout. Chocolate, caramel, and brown sugar are met with fig, black cherries and... sure, let's go with toasted coconut. Oak creeps up in the finish along with a well established alcohol and indistinguishable blend of spices. A graham cracker base only intensifies as it warms.

Now the hard part. It's sappy, sticky, rich, and smooth. Boozy, warming, sweet, and spicy. Toasty, roasty, fruity, and bold. If I rate as a delicious beer with a wonderful texture, this hits the marks. If I label it as a Winter Ale, this lacks the cleanliness and bitterness it so desperately needs.

As I browse through others reviews before my own, I've noticed a common sense of confusion in style. This, unlike original B- Bombs I've had in the past, has mistaken itself for a stout. While it is without a doubt delicious and well made in all accounts, it's not a ""Winter Ale"" unless we've just changed the prerequisites with this offering. Regardless of what it is or is not, get one if you can. It's wonderful.

Cheers.","Jan 03, 2020"
Coconut B-Bomb,,Minnesota,4.35/5,"Massive thanks, again, to rawfish for pointing me to a bottle shop with this untried gem. 22 oz. grey-waxed bottle split with my wife while sitting in my boxers in a warm San Diego kitchen. 

Dark, dank, musty, old dictionary brown gives way to vanilla, coconut, faint barrel, with a baster of allspice on the finish. Not bad, but not aggressive either. 

Coconut B-Bomb - b-bomb, a-bomb, h-bomb, all accurate. The coconut gets a Cold War escalation from mild to spine-tingling within a few degrees. Beneath being struck in the larynx with the coconut is gentle bourbon, appropriate cinnamon (not easy to do), vanilla as Ben Affleck, brown sugar, with a long, leather-smooth finish sliding into a bowl of turkey-prepped spicing. Did I mention smooth? Bloody easy to drink. 

The coconut gives a monopropellant thrust to an already lovely base beer. Sub-elite which is to say, excellent.","Dec 24, 2019"

Pours black with a surprisingly hearty head and a lot of carbonation. Smell is coffee, molasses, cocoa. If I smell coconut, it's toasted to almost burnt. There is something viscerally familiar in the aroma and I just cannot place it.

Taste is all of the above, but dominated by coconut. It works pretty nicely, as long as you like coconut. More vanilla comes across, too.

Mouthfeel is thick and velvety. Overall, really nice beer.","Dec 17, 2019"
The Greenest Green,,,4.6/5,"Pours a milky yellow orange with a fluffy off-white head. Taste is sweeter than some of the other members of the Green family, but that's countered by a pithy bitterness.

The Greenest Green,,New York,4.53/5,"This one pours a very hazy glowing orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

There’s a ton of funky and sweet pineapple on the nose here, some tropical fruit, orange tangerine, and just the lightest floral aroma.

Green is a perennial favorite from Tree House, and this is the stickiest and most greentastic version of that I’ve had yet. It’s just super saturated and thick with hop character, without tasting syrupy. There’s loads of the expected pineapple and mango here, with tons of orange and tangerine citrus, and very little bitterness. It’s just got that extra little push beyond Green or Very Green – it’s not a full on uppercut, but it’s definitely a hard shove.

This is thick and creamy, with a wonderful drinkability, and no hint at all of the 8.8% ABV.

It’s honestly old hat at this point, this is wonderful, of course it is. Tree House has come out of the other side of their expansion extremely successfully.","Aug 26, 2023"
The Greenest Green,,Canada (QC),4.49/5,"Serving: Can
Canned: Jul-27-2023
Consumed: Aug-13-2023

Pours an orangey yellow with lots of haze and a middling white head. Little lacing. Nose is pineapple and bitter orange, resiny oils, little detectable malt presence. The flavor is a wee, little burst of the rinds of those fruits followed by a big (but shortlived) wave of those same fruits… but this time just their bitter, oily, perfumey aromatics. This then dissipates into a lingering, bitter hop buzz and not much else. The mouthfeel is less of that classic round, fluffy juiciness and more total hop saturation. That said, it is quite pleasant and doesn't venture into sappy or hop burny or astringent territory. As it warms, some of the hoppy-yeasty estery sweetness as well as a scoche of malt character come out, but even then it is a one-two-three punch (that's a thing, right?) of the two main facets of the hops: Sweetbitter-bittersweet-bitter in quick succession. Regardless of any way the the beer could be better, this back and forth shift with ever sip is extremely enjoyable and impressive to have pulled off from a brewing perspective.

In looking through my reviews of a few of its predecessors, I can see how it is a clear extension of them. The main thing I notice is that in previous amped-up versions, the fruity sweetness held its own and offered a foil to the bitter resinous palate shellac potential contained within the hop profile. 

In this particular beer, though, the bitter oiliness has overtaken the rest and I have to really seek out the non-bitter aspects of it. 

They say on the can that this is a result of their series to see how far they could push the envelope before it was too much. Yeah, I could see that. Interesting to have this bitter of a Treehouse beer.

The Greenest Green,,Washington,4.44/5,"16 oz tallboy can courtesy of Roguer. No freshness date, but it's at least several months old, on a house of having received it in the fall.

Poured into a teku, this was an initially murky orange-amber color, becoming more opaque as it settled down, with a good sized off-white head. Decent amount of lace.

Big, bold aroma. Hop aroma reminiscent of tropical fruits, citrus fruits, melons and pine, in that order. Crackery malt scent as well.

Tasted pretty much as it smelled. Very fruit forward hop flavored beer. Primary flavor was reminiscent of mangoes and papaya. Lightly dry on the back end.

Medium bodied, slightly dry mouth feel.

Nice, fruit forward yet still balanced hazy double IPA. I'd say this one was a bit more dry on the back end than the Verry grrreeen I drank on Friday. Seems to have held up well during its sojourn within my fridge. Thanks, Andrew!","Mar 19, 2023"
The Greenest Green,,New York,5/5,"The appearance of Tree House Brewing's Greenest Green IPA is characterized by its bright greenish-tinged amber and hazy, cloudy appearance. This beer has a dense white head that persists for a while before dissipating, leaving behind a creamy and frothy lacing. The overall appearance of this IPA is reminiscent of a freshly-cut lawn, which perfectly matches its name Greenest Green. The aroma of The Greenest Green is a complex blend of piney and citrusy notes with a hint of earthy spiciness. The scent of fresh pine and juicy grapefruit dominate the nose, followed by subtle hints of spicy green tea and herbs. The overall aroma is fresh and invigorating, with a crisp and clean finish that leaves a lasting impression. The aroma is well-balanced, with each note playing a distinct role in creating a refreshing and satisfying experience on the nose. The Greenest Green has a hoppy and piney taste with a balance of bitterness and sweetness. The flavor profile is complex and layered, featuring hints of grapefruit, pine, and a hint of earthiness. The bitterness is assertive but not overpowering. It has a crisp and refreshing finish that is sure to leave a lasting impression on the palate. The mouthfeel of the Greenest Green is incredibly smooth and silky, with a medium to full body that is balanced by a gentle carbonation. The beer has a creamy texture, which coats the mouth and provides a luxurious and satisfying sensation. The aftertaste is smooth and satisfying, leaving a pleasant and refreshing sensation in the mouth long after the beer has been consumed.

And now for the newest (as of now) Tree House entry in the BA Top 250! Being released only 5 months ago and sitting at #225 is quite impressive. Can it live up to those expectations for some who doesn’t love their Green family beers aa much as the others? Let’s crack it open and find out

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

Thankfully it has quite a nice balance in the nose unlike most other beers in the family. I’m picking up on aromas of pineapple juice, papaya, grapefruit zest, crackery malt, overripe cantaloupe, mango, light vanilla, and grassy hops

The traditional “Green” character definitely comes through more in taste, but it actually works really nicely here despite the significant increase in hoppiness. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting sweet cantaloupe, tart pineapple, piney hops, orange zest, papaya, fresh cut grass, bready malt, and light lime juice. The swallow brings notes of grassy hops, papaya, pineapple juice, underripe mango, orange zest, weed, and a touch of booze

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm yet balanced bitterness

The Greenest Green,,Massachusetts,4.04/5,"Canned 12 days ago. Tried blind side by side with Green and Very Gggreennn. While explosive and punchy, I find that this tends towards some of the pitfalls I've noticed in some of the recent Project Find the Limit series that TH has been putting out -- namely, the hop character gets so concentrated (due to the use of concentrated hop extracts) that it ceases being tropical/fruity and starts trending towards this generic 'hop juice' that's a bit hard to describe.

The Greenest Green,,New Hampshire,4.78/5,"16 oz can.

Pours a murky golden orange color with a massive, creamy off-white head. Above average retention. Leaves a halo of lacing along the top of the glass.

The aroma is exploding with fresh pineapple, stone fruit, melon, grapefruit and orange creamsicle. Very herbaceous with a hint of bubblegum. Classic Tree House.

The flavor is, as I often say with Tree House beers, ""stupid"". Pineapple for days, honeydew melon, peach candy, apricot, mango, grapefruit and orange creamsicle. Again, quite herbaceous with a grassy, bitter finish.

True to the Green family, the mouthfeel is legendary. Medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Unbelievably soft, creamy and smooth, with a moderately dry finish.

The Greenest Green,,New Jersey,4.54/5,"If this isn't the the greatest green, I'm not sure what is as this beer's moniker was just more than a name. If you love these guys and their green offerings, this might have been one of their greatest as it was ridiculously good, even by Tree House's lofty standards!

Of course, this poured cloudy and was topped off with a full and evenly-settling foam that took ages to settle down. The milky goldenrod hue wasn't terribly bright but when you have something this appealing, that's just an afterthought. Loads of orange, orange blossom, spicy onion, dank pineapple, and exotic tropical fruit were in the nose as *all* of them burst forth in the taste. Unbelievably smooth, juicy, and addictive, green fruit, green hops, and green hints of weed were all in competition as none of those lost out in the end, with some cantaloupe, pine, earthy hops, and cream rounding out the full-bodied and varied flavor profile of this gem. The carbonation was light enough to complement everything else while hardly being noticeable and the lacing was plenty full and layered, as this had plenty of body and mango stickiness that stuck around on my palate once the last sip went down.

Sure, there's 8.8% ABV in here somewhere but you won't notice as you'll wonder who put a hole in the bottom of the can. Dated 8/17 with ""THIS BEER IS GREEN"" written above it, I loved this beer and odds are, you will too. Get a can of this and thank them ASAP!","Sep 07, 2022"

You know you're in for a treat when your beer smells like this. The flavor profile is spot on here. Opens pine. grapefruit, mango, and melon. More melon, overripe mango, and clementine in the middle. End is cane sugar, a touch of creaminess, and heaps more mango, citrus fruit, and overripe cantaloupe. Delicious. Body is light to medium with soft carbonation.

S: Aromas of pineapple, mango, and guava. A little citrus in the background, but tropical fruits dominate.

T: Huge super-ripe tropical fruit up front. Huge. Some cantaloupe underneath. Meanwhile, the hops arrive in earnest. Finishes very dry and slightly bitter. A little late heat, probably equally due to alcohol and hops.

F: Soft mouthfeel, surrounded by sticky resinous hop residue.

The Greenest Green,,New Hampshire,4.51/5,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/17/23. ‘This beer is green.’ Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours an utterly murky, dull orange-gold with a scant finger of creamy suds. Retention is nothing special and leaves a confetti-like scattering of lacing.

Nose is… oh, that fucking smell! Pineapple and candy for miles. Smell it from the next room. Take me now, Lord.

Tastes like Green. There it is. Actually, it tastes like a Green ice cream sundae. Tasting ripe pineapple on peach ice cream with dope sauce. Creamy with earthy, gritty bitterness.

Feel is thick, creamy and gritty, a medium-hefty body with fine, tingly carbonation. Just a smidge of boozy warmth in the gullet, absolutely right and proper given the 8.8% abv.

Sweet merciful Dionysus, fuck me dry if that wasn’t really greener than green! There was a tongue-numbing degree of hop saturation that bypassed bitterness and went straight to something spicy, and that created a sensation like sandpapering your palate. Fun to try and, while I applaud the sense of adventure and sheer sybaritic abandon on display here, I may be more inclined to stick to OG Green to preserve my palate’s sanity.","Aug 23, 2022"

Double Barrel Jesus,,Illinois,3.92/5,"2016 vintage; drank 2/24/17 @ the Yarchives. 

Motor oil black appearance. 

Minimal tan head; no lace. 

Marshmallow, milk chocolate, cognac & mild oak notes in the nose. 

Medium thick mouthfeel. 

Whiskey & fudge flavors up front; marshmallow & oak notes on the finish. 

Bold flavors here, but it was a hint too boozy for me to love. Close but not quite great.","Mar 05, 2019"

Not too boozy at all, but the bourbon is definitely there. Very nice mouthfeel, and overall, what a treat. Cheers!

Double Barrel Jesus,,Vermont,4.14/5,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a thick dark brown to motor oil black color with a finger's worth of tan foamy head that slid off at a mild pace. Some stringy lace concaved at the sides.
The aroma leaned to the sweeter side - thick with pure chocolate fudge, milk chocolate cake, sugar and some whiskey at the end.
The flavor was sweet all of the way through pulling in that ""cake-like"" taste to give off a bigger and fuller aftertaste that somewhat reminded me of whiskey soaked fudge.
The mouthfeel was full bodied with a pure sipping quality about it because the ABV is not only felt but somewhat noticeable in it's ""heat."" Carbonation felt fine. Finish was thick and sweet.
Overall, diabetes in a bottle. A 22 oz. bottle can be tough to take down, but I did over the course of a 4 hour period. Not for the faint of heart, I suggest to share with a buddy.","Oct 15, 2017"

L: Dark black with a light tan head. About 1F, not much retention. Leaves a thin light tan ring.

S: Bourbon and barrel dominate the nose. Dark fruits and chocolate are minor notes. This beer probably needs to be aged. Too bad I could only get one.

T: Bourbon and oak predominate taste as well. Still room for a near explosion of dark fruits (amazing) and some chocolate. Maybe a little bit of coffee. Slightly sweet and a little bit of heat from alcohol. 

F: Less full-bodied than you might expect, closer to medium. Tiny bit of carbonation. Still very young and boozy. Balance still quite good for all that.

O: It's great, but not top-tier, YET. If I find another one to age for three years, I have a feeling my score is going to increase.","Jul 21, 2017"

Double Barrel Jesus,,Pennsylvania,4.43/5,"Was cold out of the fridge. Let warm up to ~50 degrees prior to drinking.

L - Portion of a bomber partially poured hard into a snifter. Thick, heavy dark brown with dark khaki head.

S - bourbon, raisens, roast. Smells like barrel aged ten fidy. Very sweet. Very decadent.

T - Cream. Sweetness. Alcohol. Milk chocolate... and a common descriptor that I've never used before - tobacco. Very rich and decadent. Very sweet, and very potent. Great taste. Love EMJ and this is definitely a worthy barrel aged rendition.

M - hugely soft and frothy. Very big, foaming, and sticking to the palate. Think a touch thinner to bcbs but more carbonation.

O - Awesome. Stands behind bcbs and parabola but might be my third favorite BA stout. Price however is terrible. I was a little torqued about ba ten fidy being $13 but this at $25 will he a tough revisit anything but a long time again.","Apr 14, 2017"

Double Barrel Jesus,,Kentucky,4.7/5,"Striking the difference between robust, decadent and drinkable lands the double barrel aged version of Evil Twin's imperial stout in no one's land, but also everyone's land.

Double Barrel Jesus pours with an oily layering into the glass. Like syrups, a patient swirl releases a short statured but densely packed froth. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, coffee and sherry all align on the nose with a sultry sweet and savory scent. Rich with malts, the early palate accepts a lush taste of those promised chocolates, cake, caramel, cream and vanilla that sat in anticipation of flavor.

As the stout opens up, its high sweetness only recedes slighlty. Chocolate fudge, espresso, heavy cream, vanilla, molasses and brown sugar register soundly on the middle palate. Moderately bitter, the internal woodsiness of the beer trends oaken, spicy and awaiting a boozy kick of sherry, bourbon and peaten scotch whisky.

Decadent in taste and texture, the absolute fullness of the stout becomes marshmallowy, milkshake-like, and trailing with a long, savory and woodsy nuttiness.","Mar 25, 2017"

Despite all that, I can settle myself and dig in. As I do, here in this 8 ball black, short mocha headed ale, I get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel. There's just a little bite of slightly herbal wood, which I think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish.

I can see how this would have made the news in its heyday (see what I did there?), but in today's world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak, it's quite underwhelming.","Nov 23, 2021"

Clare's Thirsty Ale,,Washington,4.36/5,"Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.

Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.

Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.

The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.

Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.

I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!","May 09, 2021"

Smell - Raspberries were strong in the nose, paired with a definite bourbon presence. 

Taste - Raspberry is tough to capture in a beer. The raspberry seemed fresh, without overdoing it or making it seem artificial. The sweetness is balanced by roasted malts and a little bourbon sting. The finish was slightly warming, though never overly sweet. 

Mouthfeel - Before there were slushies with gobs of fruit puree, Haymarket made a nice thick stout with fruit. 

Overall - I enjoyed this beer as the raspberries were well presented and not artificial tasting.","Mar 14, 2020"

T: Raspberry is a bit more prominent, with cocoa powder, sweet dark molasses, and hefty roastiness. Finishes with moderate puckering tannic sensation. The roast, tannins, and sweetness are a little too prominent and throw it out of balance. 

M: Full bodied, thick, with mild carbonation. Very mild alcohol warmth.

Clare's Thirsty Ale,,Illinois,4.46/5,"Pours a shiny pitch black color. Thick velvety dark mocha colored head dissipates slowly and only partially. A good 1/4 inch of velvety foam remains on the beer. Thick, viscous almost fudgy when poured into the glass. 

Aroma has notes of dark roasted malts, tobacco ash, hints of tart raspberry giving way to a warming bourbon and oak aroma. Notes of vanilla, dark fruits and some light earthy pine hop notes. 

Taste has notes of dark roasted malts, a light tart fresh raspberry flavor with some piney hoppy notes on the back end. As the beer is consumed you get the bourbon, oak, charred oak and vanilla notes coming through as they warm the palate. the barrel character here is well balanced within the beer profile overall. 

Feel is thick, fudgey, and incredibly smooth. Very mild carbonation - just enough to keep it from coming across as still. Semi-dry finish.

Clare's Thirsty Ale,,Minnesota,4.56/5,"I'm not generally one for fruited stouts - adjuncts in stouts should be restricted to vanilla, cinnamon, coffee, nuts, and whatever that isn't a fruit. But, Clare's Thirsty Ale was on the top 250 for years, so I had to try it.

Usually berry adjuncts come across as medicinal to me, except in sours - but this seems to be something of an exception. The raspberry is pungently present in the nose, but somehow does not have either a syrupy or astringent presence in the taste notes or mouth feel. There's also very low acidity to the berry, which is impressive - raspberry almost always imparts just a bit of acidity. Not so here, which is nice. The beer is fairly creamy in mouth feel, with loads of chocolate, and is quite smooth. No small feat for such a high ABV. There's definitely heat to the beer - I drank this on an empty stomach and found myself stumbling a bit. Oops. Still, not booze to the taste, just a bit of heat in the chest.

I see exactly why this beer is so respected. I think I actually prefer it over Jam the Radar, particularly as regards format. Pretty impressive.

Clare's Thirsty Ale,,Colorado,4.34/5,"been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance. this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer, strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale, like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something, but this is anything but, and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one. a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries, and a wonderful one at that. i go back and forth on the fruited stouts, sometimes they get way too sweet and candy-like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars, but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this, so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities, its also really natural tasting, clean, and fairly acidic from their tartness. its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer. sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here, its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it, and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well, but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me. rye is a smart choice for barrels too, its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been, and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me. light vanilla too, but it isnt desserty so much. dark cocoa, a little bitterness, and whiskey, along with old school raspberry jam in the finish, its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be. this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel, but other than that beer, quite original. worth the hype!","Oct 20, 2017"

Not quite clear amber body with an active champagne fist receding to a small fine cap. Vague, sloppy lacing; no legs. Very good retention.

Subtle yet complex aroma - herbaceous and floral with a delicate funk bringing to mind superior washed rind cheese.

Palate entry brings to mind alfalfa fields, sorrel, and salty sea breezes. Tart but not bracingly so. Low earthy bitterness comes and goes. Goat milk, lanolin, crisp malt, and raw nuts. Finishes dry with earth, minerality, umami, and a hint of funk. 

Medium-light bodied, well carbonated, nearly refreshing, but still soft.

Clear, medium gold colored body. One finger of white head sticks around as rising bubbles replenish. Slight strings of lacing.
Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins.
Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.
Mouth feel is light and substantial at the same time. Bubbly, and high in carbonation.

Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass.

Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet. 

Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar!

Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied.

This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next!","Mar 14, 2022"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Missouri,4.49/5,"Pours a foggy, hazy burnt orange with a half finger of white fizzy foam. Head bubbles away quickly. Aroma is peach and apricot for fleshy fruits, but not overly juicy. It adds just a touch of initial sweetness. Stone, grass, and oak round it out. It has a slight tart funk to it, but is not 'sour'. Acidity remains balanced, and low. Flavor profile is stone, oak, grass, herbal, peach and faint apricot. It leads with that heavy stone, grassy, yeasty character, with a little build up of fruits at the finish. Tartness remains light or faint, offering just a touch of dynamic at the end. Acidity is low. Mouth feel is still in effervescence with just a little sparse pulp for any additional texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a sublime lambic that packs elegance into every sip. It's not big, bold, or brash, instead developing an endearing personality.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,California,4.26/5,"375ml, bottling date 1/25/17

A: pours a deep burnt orange with a couple fingers of frothy tan head that faded away into a thin bubbly collar with soapy lace. 
S: musty earth/wood, bright acidity, mild citrus, wood, grain, and apple notes. 
T: follows the nose with musty/damp flavors and soft citrus, with the addition of darker grain/dark bread flavors. I get a touch of dark fruit followed by a cider-like note in the finish and apple skins in the aftertaste. There’s a earthy spice throughout along with a lingering funk to the aftertaste. 
M: frothy, creamy carbonation complimented by acidity that is sharp but quick. Medium body with a little chew to it. Not bone dry or thin. Acidity lingers but this drinks well. But if you want a few of the last sharp corners rounded off, give this a few more years of age. This is still pretty bright for 5 years. 
O: I had to pop a bottle on the day of Armand’s passing and felt this was a good fit. A lovely beer, just like the lovely man I hear Armand was. Fuck cancer; rest in piece.","Mar 07, 2022"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Illinois,4.57/5,"Pours a cloudy opaque brownish tinged orange color. Very thin, fleeting off-white head appears as the beer is poured, but dissipates almost instantly. The aroma on this is very complex - there is a moderate funkiness on the nose that is immediately noticeable. Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character.

The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable.

The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish.

Overall its a remarkable beer - delicious, complex, challenging, yet oddly drinkable. A fitting beer to carry the name of Armand Debelder","Mar 06, 2022"

A- pours a clear golden amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention

S- bright and fruity nose with aromas of ripe pear, green apple, lemon peel, orange marmalade and white grapes. Plenty of funk undertones provide aromas of oak, barnyard funk, wet hay, fermented apples, leather and cracked pepper

T- fruity notes of ripe pears, green apples, lemon pith and citrus zest up front, followed by a backbone of funk, providing notes of hay, lemon tartness, yogurt and some barnyard funk. The finish is fruity and funky, with notes of more pear and lemon, funky linger

M- light-medium body with low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that finishes foamy and dry, just enough tartness lingering on the mouth

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Ohio,4.81/5,"Large bomber, bottled Jan 2019, opened 12/26/2021 at ~50 degrees F and poured into a Tripel Karmeliet tulip.

L: Pours a lovely clear burnished bronze-gold, and forms a thick, fluffy white head with great retention.

S: Funky, mildewy old dried hay, with sourdough biscuits being baked nearby, and some moldering orange peels.

T: Sharply tart underripe citrus opens, with a soft metallic tinge. That quickly segues into a swirl of sour white grapes, vinosity, green apple, and rancid honeydew melon, with a grass and mildew undertone. Old wood and pollen manifest by the finish, the aftertaste of which lingers as tart sour orange with mold and metal.

F: Verging between light and medium, with moderate carbonation.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Texas,4.44/5,"One of my Thanksgiving beers!

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Beautiful clear orangish yellow color with brief head and good lasting lacing. Wonderful smell and taste of tart apples and pears. Dry white wine.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,New Jersey,4.93/5,"It just doesn't get any better than this. Deep-flavored lambic while also maintaining its delicate profile. Vintage was 2017-2018, consumed in late 2021. Clear gold color with a thin, yet long-lasting pure white head. Lacing doesn't quit. Very champagne-like in flavor--tastes range from white grapes to citrus to oak, with a bit of funk. Sweet up front, with a semi-dry finish. This is some special stuff, quite possibly the best geuze I've had. Save it for a special occasion, but make it an annual purchase because every year brings new qualities.","Nov 19, 2021"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,New Hampshire,4.24/5,"12.7 oz bottle. January 2018 vintage.

Pours a hazy amber orange color with a finger of sudsy off-white head. Minimal retention. Leaves a nice ring of lacing around the top of the glass.

Tons of funk and earthy notes right off the bat. There's a good amount of white wine grapes and vinegar, grass, damp hay, oak chips, and lemon. There's a hint of sweet citrus, almost like clementines, with some very faint cracked pepper. Not overly complex, but definitely an enticing aroma.

The flavor builds on the nose, adding a sweet, almost honey like character. Lots of citrus, funk, and oak. There's a subtle nutty flavor lingering in the back. Plenty of vinegar acidity, with a touch of tart cherries and raspberries.

The feel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Sharp, crisp bite, with a relatively dry finish. The acidity lingers a bit on the palate before the sheet gets pulled.

Overall, this is a great Lambic that's full of flavor and balance. It doesn't quite have the ""Wow"" factor that I expected, but it's still a well-crafted and highly drinkable beer. Complex, but not overly so. Accessible enough for people unfamiliar with the style.","Oct 07, 2021"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Massachusetts,4.13/5,"Season 17/18, blend 57, bottled 5/22/18

Time to crack open my first 3 Fonteinen! This is currently the 7th highest rated Gueuze, and the 185th highest rated beer overall. I’m making slow but steady progress on trying the top 250. Anyhow, I’m excited for this one and I’m in the mood for something funky so this is perfect. Picked this up at Julians in Providence yesterday while I was getting takeout on lunch break. Let’s pop it open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with just a finger of white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Oh yeah, that’s super funky in the nose, a bunch of earthy notes all coming together. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, wet hay, white wine vinegar, apple skin, old leather, sharp oak, lemon rind, and straw

Surprisingly, there’s not too much depth to the flavor on this one, the nose was quite misleading. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon rind, sharp oak, light vinegar, and straw. The swallow picks up a bit thankfully, bringing notes of apple skin, wet hay, pear, white pepper, old leather, and minerally white wine

A medium body pairs with fine tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp tart beer. Finishes mostly dry with an intense funk

I liked this well enough, but nothing that actively amazed me. Maybe it came down to how the beer was stored so I can’t knock it too hard","Sep 30, 2021"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Canada (ON),4.42/5,"375 ml cork and cage bottle. Served fairly cold into pint glass. 2018/19 vintage with a best before date of late 2038. Cost was $14.25 CDN. One bought to celebrate a house close, the other for some event in the future. Listed at 7.1% ABV. Super stoked to get a couple bottles from this world famous (2nd most famous?) lambic creator. Blend 13.

Appearance - Hazy rich coppery gold brew with a small half finger of white head that fizzles out in a minute or two. Even some reddish hues to this brew.

Smell - Complex! Starts with hints of balsamic vinegar, but there's a woody and smoky undercurrent. Orange marmalade fits in there. There's a mustiness and something like rich leather. Some earthy barnyard funk fits in there. Other fruits, maybe apricot or peach show vaguely for an instant. A lot going on, but it's like a pleasant journey with the senses rather than an assault. As it warms... something perfumey or floral that I can't quite put my finger on.

Taste - hints of vinegar again, orange marmalade with a light smoky flavor. Leather mixed in as well with some sweetness from apricots. A sprinkle of white pepper at the back end and all this wrapped around a slightly musty and earthy body. Kind of surreal with how much is going on. Overall, tart but not overpowering.

Mouthfeel - Medium-light bodied, bright expressive carbonation. Booze quotient is invisible until it hits the back of the throat, then you realize there's some booze here. Light tingly sensation. Initially moist but then finishes quite dry.

Overall - Wonderful brew, super duper complex. This isn't a style I have tons of experience with nor is it a favorite style, however I can certainly respect and enjoy (some of) the complexities and nuances of this brew. While Gueuzes have always been a complex style full of nuance this Cuvee blended by Armand & Gaston ramps it up to a whole new level.
Definitely worth the purchase and I very much look forward to drinking the second bottle some years into the future and providing a comparison. What a brew.","Sep 13, 2021"
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,,Texas,4.59/5,"bottled Sept 27 2018; today is 6/22/21

pours a slightly hazy peach-gold body with a billowing, fluffy burnt cream colored head that has moderate retention and leaves no lacing behind as it settles to a murky cap with defined halo

aroma is funky apricot/bright stone fruit and...olive? yep. little bit in there. there's a complimentary spiciness on the wings, along with a vinegar-like tinge 

taste an expansion of these aroma notes; the vinegar, olive, and bright stone fruit (along with green apple) come together with a flash of sudden extreme unity before dispersing and layering with the sweet brightness of the fruit hitting first, the robust olive splitting up the party, and the vinegar symbolically bringing it all back home. 

mouthfeel is high carbonation and mid-level body, running slightly crisp yet full and nearly mellow before finishing with a lightly sweet vinegar tinged dryness. 

overall:
sublime. complex. enjoyably easy. sometimes you really can have it all.

A translucent orange with pink highlights, little to no head or lace. No sign of yeast poop or sediment. The aroma is slightly sour, cherry, pear…there’s something lurking underneath, can’t quite place it. A flavor surge commences, slightly sour, olive, pear/apple cider. The initial olive notes fade a couple sips in. Whatever was lurking in the aroma starts appearing in the finish as it warms. Some type of funk or oak? Pear orange and pepper notes strengthen while maintaining a moderate amount of sourness. The feel is medium, carbonation medium high with a sharp finish. Everything melds together as it warms. Still learning to gauge this style. Worth a go. What does this develop into after 30 years? I can’t properly cellar anything that long (a year is a success) , though I may grab another one and try.","Jun 18, 2021"

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Connecticut,4.46/5,"Bottom line: this is a delectable pastry stout worthy of Angry Chair's lofty reputation. They simply seem to have mastered some sort of alchemy regarding the style that few, if any, can match.

It's perhaps not a dead ringer for the namesake dessert ... but it honestly isn't far off, and the resemblance grows with successive sips. It's sweet, but not cloying; realistically, it's more rich and decadent than sweet. The coconut is a lovely light touch, never overbearing, but adding another layer to the profile. Chocolate and vanilla are prominent, joined by molasses, cherry, and caramel from the malt base. Incredibly long finish, including lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, and vanilla.

This is another absolute home run from Angry Chair. Every single time I have one of their highest-rated pastry stouts, I think there's absolutely no way it can possibly live up to the hype ... and then it not only matches, but surpasses the hype.","Sep 07, 2023"
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,New Hampshire,4.42/5,"From a 32oz crowler, filled at the brewery 06/03/23. Served in a tulip.

Pours a thick-and-viscous appearing motor oil black. A scant quarter-finger of coffee-colored suds lasts a half-minute or so, leaving a soft, creamy collar and a barely rousable oily, sugary film of super-slippery lacing.

Nose is roasty-malty, nutty and mildly sweet. Aromas of fudge and dark roast coffee. Some nuttiness and woody, husky coconut as it warms.

Taste is fudgy-sweet - but much less sweetness than anticipated. Tasting brown sugar chocolate vanilla fudge, molasses-sweetened coffee and - more prominently and notably as the beer warms - an earthy, woody nuttiness, ground bitter walnut, thick and heavy perfumy vanilla and husky coconut. Nice! Alcohol is hardly noticeable.

Feel is smooth and viscous, dense but less thick and heavy than it appeared going into the glass! with super-fine, prickly carbonation making it feel a little lighter than it might otherwise. I want to say that it feels ‘sugary,’ like sugar water but that’s totally hallucinatory - it tastes like it should feel sugary but it does not. Abv is hardly evident.

Overall, outstanding! I like to buy these sweet and sticky pastry stouts mainly so that I can complain about them and leave bad reviews but this was so damn good that I was wishing I hadn’t offered to share it with Boy and Spouse. Mammosilenus, who never likes stouts, stole several ounces of this and then came back looking for more and had to be beaten back.","Jun 10, 2023"

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout is sweeter than my Grandma (no, not really, nothing sweeter than Gen! Plus, she made killer buns). Wow. The cocoa. And this from a confirmed chocolate addict. All the chocolates. Vanilla shows after a good spell of warming along with a smidge of coconut. No toast. Nothing to offset the ridiculous sweetness. Full, big, but a small sample of this would have left me content. 75 minutes in & not half done.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Virginia,4.21/5,"2019 vintage. Released a week or two ago.  A: Pours jet black with a cap of medium brown, espresso-like head. Recedes quickly to a razor-thin ring. Average retention and a few streaks and dots of lacing.

S: Loads of toasted coconut, an undertone of vanilla extract, nuts, a bit of dark chocolate and roast. The coconut dominates the aroma almost to the exclusion of anything else.

T: Again, just loads of toasted coconut with a bit of dark chocolate bar, vanilla, and light roast through the finish. Extremely sweet, though the sweetness works well enough with the flavors (even if it’s a bit much).

M: Full bodied, super velvety, with light carbonation. Touch of alcohol heat. Pretty exceptional body to this.

 O: Solid coconut-forward pastry stout, though extreme sweetness makes drinking more than ~4oz difficult. A little age might soften the overwhelming coconut aspect.","Feb 06, 2019"
Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Indiana,4.49/5,"Appearance - The beer poured a big black inky black color with a deep mocha head. 

Smell - The beer has a tremendous boozy chocolate nose. Far from hot, the alcohol lets you know it’s there. 

Taste - My first thought was alcoholic milk chocolate. As things progressed, vanilla and coconut were noticeable. The coconut paired well with the coconut, keeping a sense of balance. The chocolate is lightly warming in the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel - Little bubbles in the carbonation made the beer silky smooth. There was tremendous body with this beer.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Netherlands,3.94/5,"Got this one from rutger this past summer. Cheers! 

From a 750ml bottle into a snifter
Batch 1: 2018
ABV: 10.5% edition

APPEARANCE: Clear black pour yields a 2+ finger, fizzy looking, noisy tan head with lousy retention. Head fizzes down to a decent foam cap and then eventually to a wisp. Black body with minimal carbonation evident. A ring remains leaving falling lace down the glass as it empties. 

SMELL: Milk chocolate, vanilla cream and cake icing, chocolate chip cookies with roasted malts as well. Nice nose. 

TASTE: Milk chocolate, vanilla cream, toffee flavors, chocolate chip cookies and butterscotch up front. Flavorful and lots of sweetness. Bold finish of vanilla cream, milk chocolate, toffee and butterscotch sweetness, cookies and vanilla icing. Flavorful and sweet. 

PALATE: Fuller body and lower carbonation. Creamy and silky on the palate, slick and smooth, enough weight, goes down fine and finishes slick and sticky. A touch of heat lingers. 

OVERALL: Good stuff. The sweetness and chocolate additions really work nice, and it has a big, silky feel to it as well. Lots of flavor and character to enjoy and drinks away far too quickly. This would probably barrel age really well. Well worth checking out if you’re a fan of the style and something I would gladly drink again. Thanks again, rutger!","Dec 23, 2018"

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,,Minnesota,4.55/5,"Crazy though I may be, I actually prefer the non-barrel-aged bottle of Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout over the barrel-aged bottle.

This bottle, though not barrel-aged, is plenty rich and sweet enough - the chocolate to the nose and taste is thick and very pleasant, without any tangible heat from the ABV. It's quite pleasant without being too much in any particular regard, though it is tremendously sweet.

Pours a deep brown, nearly black opaque body with a dark brown smallish head that sticks around for a minute or so before reduces to a ring of retention. Spotty lacing. 

Aromas are the epitome of a pastry stout - straight chocolate cake with vanilla frosting, cocoa, Hershey's syrup, rich chocolate truffles. 

On the tongue it's pretty sweet with tons of vanilla and chocolate, cocoa, roasty chocolate malt, coffee cake, fudgy brownies topped with caramel drizzle. Rich, decadent mouthfeel, medium-low carbonation with a heavy body. 

Quite a delightful beer, this is the definition of a pastry stout. It's liquid cake. I've had the barrel aged version and while the barrel adds an extra dimension, and makes this beer that much better, this is quite a treat.","Sep 23, 2018"

Double Stack,,Pennsylvania,3.94/5,"Double Stack from Great Notion. 16 fl oz can from @snaotheus in NBW BIF 17. Reviewed 14/05/23 (Review 3101). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Top rim of can stamped “STICKY STACKS 03.06.23”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 46.2 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 54.5 degrees F. 
Appearance – 4.25 
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, opaque with light penetration at the edges – ruby.
Head: Average (Maximum 1.1 cm, aggressive center pour), tan, high density, quickly diminishing, reducing to a 0.2 cm crown constantly renewed by carbonation, and a thin partial cap. 
Lacing – Poor. Thin line of near-microscopic bubbles.
Aroma – 4.5 – When the tab is popped, instant aroma of coffee and maple syrup! Weak roasted malt, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on the label). 
Flavor – 3.5 – Moderately bitter coffee with maple syrup flavor as backing. Bitterness enhanced by the char flavor. No malt, no yeast, no hops. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Slight gastric warming. 
Palate – 4 – Medium; watery short of syrupy/creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4 Without the char bitterness, I would have rated the flavor 4.5; for my taste buds, the char nearly ruined the maple/coffee combo. Otherwise, this is a very good coffee stout. And that “natural flavor and caramel color” screams “Unnecessary crap added”.","May 14, 2023"
Double Stack,,Massachusetts,4.4/5,"Canned 3/6/23. ""Sticky stacks"" stamped on the side of the can

It's finally time to try this classic from Great Notion thanks to Tavour. It's their most reviewed beer on BA and their only one to have entered the top 250. This should be their magnum opus. Will it be? Let's crack it open and find out

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head that slowly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is absolutely a maple bomb in the nose, but the coffee plays a nice supporting role as well. I'm picking up on aromas of maple syrup, milk chocolate, burnt caramel, medium roast coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, and straight up pancakes

It's surprisingly much more bitter in taste compared to the nose, not to say that it's super bitter but it has a nice bite. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting raw maple, dark roast coffee, charred malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, molasses, light raisin, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, cacao nibs, burnt caramel, charred malt, dark toast, and light molasses

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sweet beer with a bite. Finishes a tad sticky but nothing that hurts the drinkability

It's not reinventing the wheel of maple adjuncted Stouts, but it's damn good nonetheless","May 13, 2023"
Double Stack,,Oregon,4.7/5,"Very dark brown color. Aroma is very maple forward with a lot of vanilla, pastry, and coffee notes.

Double Stack,,Iowa,4.77/5,"On tap at The Brass Tap, Cedar Falls, IA. Served in a 5-ounce snifter. Pitch black in color, with a thin tan head. Absolutely huge aromas and flavors of maple syrup, dark roast coffee, pancakes, and char. Lots of roasty malt bitterness, without much attendant sweetness. Slightly boozy, with a syrupy mouthfeel. Notes of bitterness and char linger on the palate long after the finish. Overall, well crafted and highly recommended.","Apr 28, 2023"
Double Stack,,,4.71/5,"Aroma gives off a strong, alluring waft of maple and chocolatey malt. Taking a drink feels like getting a huge bite out of a big, fluffy, delicious Belgian waffle coated in maple syrup, followed by a roasty bite of coffee. Nothing I've ever had comes so close to the maple taste, every sip is a breakfast meal in one. Top tier!","Apr 26, 2023"
Double Stack,,California,4.19/5,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery snifter

A: Pours basically black with a frothy tan brown head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some thin lacing.

S: Opening the can is like opening the door to a sugar shack as you're met with a wave of maple, followed by bold coffee, roasty malt, a little char, and faint smoke, light earthy notes, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and slightly toasty biscuity bready pancake-y-ness.

T: Opens with a huge hit of maple syrup, followed by milk chocolate, vanilla, and a nice touch of coffee that leads into roasty malt, a little char, and a touch of smoke, with underlying mild earthy and slightly nutty notes, toffee, and toasty biscuity/bready malt very reminiscent indeed of a stack of pancakes.

M: Full body, somewhat mild carbonation, pretty smooth though somehow I would describe it as especially creamy, alcohol is rather well hidden giving just the slightest touch of warmth as it comes up to room temp.

O: I've had a couple cans of this sitting in the fridge for a few years now, just waiting for the right night to crack into my special liquid souvenirs from a great road trip. But as time passed and that night never came, I got on the lookout for a fresh can to purposely do the opposite with; to push to the front of the line as quickly as possible and try fresh. A lucky shipment of cans hit my area recently, so here we are, cracking into a can that's a little more than a month old. 

This beer probably has the strongest maple presence of any beer I've ever had, including CBS. To their credit, you definitely get the sensation of taking a big bite of pancakes dripping with syrup after just taking a sip of your morning mocha. Unfortunately, that kinda leads into its downfall. While it is true to their own description of having an ""extreme maple syrup flavor"", it can come off as ungodly sweet up front. Not gonna lie, I'm also a little weary of the label saying ""coffee, maple syrup, natural flavor, and caramel color"", potentially meaning there's some kinda maple or 'pancake extract' in there. This one is fun to try, but could really benefit from some balance; upping the coffee, backing the maple down a notch, maybe even both would help make it less of a novelty and more of an enjoyable sipper you go back to. Maybe some age will do the trick. I'll definitely update when that right night comes along and I get into my vintage cans. For now, I'd say it's a cool one to try as a short pour, but it can get overwhelming in greater volumes.","Apr 21, 2023"

The taste follows the nose: maple syrup, chocolate, coffee in the finish (lending some bitterness) and a nice roasted malt profile. Full-bodied with a thick feel.

Thicket,,Connecticut,3.56/5,"Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21

Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass.

Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close.

Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish.

Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product.","Jan 14, 2021"
Thicket,,Maine,4.03/5,"Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F.

Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance. 

Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant. 

Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry. 

Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins. 

Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing.","Jan 14, 2021"

Thicket,,Illinois,4.19/5,"375ml bottle, generously shared by Erik, poured into a Side Project oversized wine glass. Enjoyed on 6.20.15, reviewed from Tasting Journal.


The beer pours a really nice purple/red color, opaque and hazy, really reminiscent of a blackberry with a slightly off white head, about a finger high that has nice retention and good lace. The aroma is welcoming, lots of blackberry, acidic red wine, hearty oak, funky yeast, lemon zest and tangy red grape linger well. The flavors are quite enjoyable, tart and fresh blackberry, juicy and jammy, red wine acidity, chewy oak, good funk, a little cheesy with a nice amount of mustiness, lemon zest cuts into the sourness a little, despite it's tart character, but offers some brightness and like the nose, lingering red grape and currants, fleshy and puckery. The mouthfeel is good, coating, zippy and lively with high carbonation levels, good dry tartness and an easy finish that has a crisp kick.


Verdict: A nice Wild Ale from Side Project, not overly sour, which I find to be a typical attribute with their fruited sours. Tart, acidic, balanced and a nice blackberry expression, not quite as epic and Fuzzy or Framboise du Fermier in terms of the representation of the fruit used, but very enjoyable nonetheless.","Jul 29, 2015"

Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.

(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.


I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)


Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.

Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.

Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.

It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!

Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season.""","Aug 03, 2022"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Minnesota,4.45/5,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).

Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers. 

It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.

So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.

Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).

Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.

Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.

Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.

The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).

Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!","Feb 28, 2022"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Minnesota,4.53/5,"REview#1600,This thing is all barrel, but that's not a bad thing in this case. If I had to say something bad about it I would say it is sorta harsh and abrasive at times, overpowering and (this sounds dumb) kinda too smooth at other times... unbeer-like if that makes sense, tastes like some sort of new better drink that supersedes beer into a more betterer territory","Feb 18, 2022"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Indiana,4.35/5,"Pours black with leakage to mahogany brown on the edges and a tan head. The nose has oaky, boozy barrel notes, some dark chocolate, and stone fruit.

Appearance: 4 - extremely black, and a bit thin. Head fizzled away immediately.

Taste: 5 - basically all barrel. Fruitier than some other big stouts for sure. Reminds me a little of Surly Darkness, which can almost pass for a quad.

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Ohio,4.3/5,"Glossy black with a short mocha blanket settling to a soft persistent collar.

This has an excellent balance between the wonderfully nutty, smoothly roasty stout body and the sticky, syrupy barrel character that dries out nicely on the swallow. The barrel provides Raisinettes, coconut drizzle, and bruleed toffee notes within the whiskey that's warming but measured.

The body is actually moderately light and silky with a light crackly carbonation that comes to a semi-dry finish at first, but then leaves a light stickiness on the lips.","Oct 18, 2019"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,North Carolina,4.25/5,"750 ml bottle into snifter; 2018 vintage, bottle #4949. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a small fairly dense khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with big strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, toffee, bourbon, toasted oak, roasted nuts, biscuit, and dark/brown bread/crust; with lighter notes of vanilla, coconut, licorice, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, smoke, charcoal, leather, tobacco, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/roast/toasted earthiness.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a nice roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with no cloying, acrid, astringent flavors after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from lingering bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky/velvety/bready, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is fantastic, Minimal warming alcohol for 10%, with no lingering barrel booze after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged Russian imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malts, moderate bourbon barrels, and light fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV, with the minimally bitter/tannic/drying finish. Fantastic soft feel. Not as much barrel as I expected, but adequate. Fantastic rich malt complexity; solid barrel presence/integration, restrained fruity yeast, and mild earthy hops. Not overly sweet/heavy from lingering dryness. A highly enjoyable offering, and impressive spot on style example.","Aug 18, 2019"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,North Carolina,4.66/5,"Jet black with a dark brown head that retreats to the edges of the glass. The aroma is an amazing blend of bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, raisins and caramel. The taste is exactly the same as the smell with the bourbon up front and the rest of the flavors coming in after that. There is a nice bitterness that lingers with the sweetness of the raisins and caramel at the end. Just a delicious stout.","Jun 30, 2019"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Alabama,4.55/5,"2019 bottle. 12oz, 11% ABV.

The pour is dark and viscous, poured cold so allowed room to warm, so not much of any rising head or visible carbonation. A thin beige ring surrounds the top of the beer in the glass.

A huge chocolatey aroma reminds me of brownie batter, with a nice underlying complexity of molasses and dark fruit. There's a roasty malt character to this as well, but that initial chocolate dessert sweetness really wins the day on the nose.

A fantast contrast in the flavor profile brings out a ton of barrel character, as well as a much stronger emergence of those dark fruits and molasses characteristics. The barrel brings out additional flavors of vanilla, oak, and bourbon, and roasty dark coffee begins to grab a good bit of influence as well as it warms further. In the finish its all bourbon, with a familiar boozy spice on the tail.

Warming, smooth, viscous. As it slips down the back, there's a good level of residual mouth-coating, and does well to accompany a boozy burn down the hatch. Definitely would consider a full-bodied beer, and drinks like more of a 14+% BA stout, in all the best ways possible.","Jun 26, 2019"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Massachusetts,4.28/5,Really slick and tasty and does everything I’d want for a bba Stout.

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Wisconsin,4.56/5,"Ok, so I recently picked up some of these down here in Milwaukee. Never had it before, was on my want list for several years now. 

Poured a dark near black. Smells heavily barrel forward, and not cheap barrel at that. Tastes like the nose; barrel forward with the beer itself complimenting the notes of the barrel. Barrel lingers in the mouth for a bit then fades to the base beer.

If you want a BA stout that isnt barrel dominant, this isn't for you. Interestingly, though, I usually fall in that camp and I absolutely love this beer and am hoarding all I can find of it.","Apr 02, 2019"
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,,Minnesota,4.73/5,"2019 vintage. Have had most of Lift Bridge's offering and found them to be good but not exceptional; Silhouette is the latter. Pours pitch black with some light barely visible at the top edge in my Spiegelau stout glass. Delicious meld of coffee and bourbon on the nose. Flavor profile goes together perfectly, not too much bourbon but the perfect amount IMHO and not too boozy but just right. Nice full body but not too much either. This is fantastic and given the choice of this or some of the better know BA stouts like BCBS, CBS or KBS I've enjoyed, I'd pick this over them.","Mar 23, 2019"

Pours pitch black with a small, wispy toffee colored head. Sporadic lacing. Aroma is coffee and chocolate and figs and alcohol. Mouthfeel is a little thin for my liking. Slightly watered down but wonderful flavor overall. I enjoyed the draft version more and this bottle was a bit of a letdown. Solid beer but plenty better.","Jul 20, 2023"
Bomb!,,,4.75/5,"Look: exceptionally dark brown, almost black. Very thin mocha colored head, minor lacing. 

Smell: very well-mixed chocolate and vanilla fight for dominance. Moderately strong coffee and malt. 

Taste: follows the nose. The chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and malt sweetness are all present. Nothing is overpowering. No real taste of chile peppers until the back end (see feel). 

Feel: rich, silky, velvety, and smooth. Low carbonation as expected given the style and the 13% abv. Warmth from the alcohol during and after swallow. Tingling spice on the tongue (from the chile peppers) long after the swallow. 

Overall: one of the best - and possibly THE best - adjunct imperial stout I have ever had the fortune of trying. Exquisitely well-balanced flavors.","Jul 05, 2023"

Look- Black, opaque, plentiful visible particulate at the edges, dark brown frothy head, zero head retention, below average lacing (but coats glass wall).

Smell- Cacao, coffee, chili pepper, vanilla, high strength of scent.

Taste- Cacao, coffee, chili pepper at finish, moderately bitter, high strength of flavor.

Feel- Between medium and full body, well below average carbonation, mildly spicy, moderately mouth warming, mildly mouth coating, moderately bitter, syrup like.

Overall- Black in color with visible particulate at the edges and zero head retention. Bouquet was high in strength with a great mix of cacao, coffee and chili pepper. Taste was also high in strength with the same wonderful flavor profile. Feel was between medium and full bodied with mild spiciness and moderate mouth warming ability. Overall this was a really great beer that provided an excellent drinking experience. The only critique I had was that the carbonation was noticeably weak, but that could have been a one-off.","Mar 17, 2023"
Bomb!,,New Hampshire,4.22/5,"From a 12oz bottle, dated 03/17/22. Served in a tulip.

Pours a slightly thick-appearing chestnut-black with a finger of dense mocha foam. The head holds up for thirty seconds or so - actually pretty good considering the abv - leaving a scant collar and a barely rousable spattering of super-slippery lacing.

Nose is rich and chocolatey. Aromas of milk chocolate and chilis. 

Taste is candy bar-like, mildly sweet, nutty and lightly roasted. Sweetened coffee taste is present but dominated by Lindt-type milk chocolate at the beginning, then by ancho chili and vanilla on the back end. Tasting demerara sugar, mocha java, ancho chili and vanilla. There’s a subtle nutty, peanut buttery character at the end and into the aftertaste.

Feel is smooth and creamy, not much more than medium bodied I think, but further lightened by the ample, fine carbonation. It’s a notably clean mouthfeel considering the style, the abv, and the various adjuncts.

Overall, nice. Clean-drinking and tasty, only lightly sweet and not at all syrupy. At least comparable to many of the finer imperial stouts I’ve met but perhaps at a more regrettably unattractive relative price point.","Feb 14, 2023"
Bomb!,,,4.65/5,"L: Thick motor oil poured from a 12oz bottle into a sniffer - slight head risen. No light shining through this one.
S: Big coffee aromas followed by chocolate, vanilla and a slight spicy smell to it. Reminds me of a Ducato imperial stout that was made with chili peppers.
T: Ohhh wow, Definitely an AMAZING beer!! Huge spicy chili chocolate up front followed by a easy vanilla ride to the coffee profile in the after taste. Man oh man this one is top 5 in the books.
F: Spicy, acidic, heavy bodied beer - not to carbonated. Easy to drink, can't taste the alcohol at all.
O: This reminds me of a similar imperial stout made with spices that resemble chili peppers. This for me is a barrel aged version of Ducato Verdi Imperial Stout but with different characteristics that make it much more complex such as a spicy bakers chocolate upfront taste followed by a smooth vanilla ride to the end where the coffee after taste lingers. Very well done and a solid A+ for me.","Feb 05, 2023"

Bomb!,,New Jersey,4.05/5,"12 ounce bottle in a stemmed stout glass.

Midnight black color topped with a dirty dark brown cap. The head stands tall, momentarily, drops to a half-finger, then disappears. Lacing is limited to a few spots.

There’s roast in the aroma, coffee and malt. Strong vanilla, modest cocoa and pepper. 

Vanilla coffee with additives. More like sweet milk chocolate than cocoa. Barely a hint of chili pepper.

Thin feel, in a good way. It’s like a cup of black coffee.

This pour came in at 12% abv. It’s good but not up to my expectations.","Nov 13, 2022"

Feel: Another notch over Pirate Weekend, it doesn't feel like I am sucking down oil which is nice, I appreciate a beer that's not super heavy.

Bomb!,,,4.99/5,"Simply a perfect beer. First the history- Prairie Bomb! changed the alcohol laws in Oklahoma to open up the door for higher alcohol content beers and a wave of new craft breweries. The complexity is incredible. In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation. Slight bubbles, small head are a delicate balance which is also hard with this style. Appropriately named, this one will sneak up on you.

Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.

Moderate level of head, which is medium brown. It recedes into a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer.

2008 vintage bottle served in a Lost Abbey teku and enjoyed on 07/27/14 alongside Veritas 010.

Appearance: The beer pours a cloudy yellow-orange peach color that is a darker hue than the Veritas 010, with a thin later of head that settles to a ring around the glass. Has a lovely fade with an orange-ish center (this is sadly not particularly apparent in my photo). No lacing or retention. 4.5/5

Smell: Peach/peach syrup, oak, tannins and vanilla. So lovely. A hint of must and stone fruit. Has a little zesty, mildly jammy character. Quite remarkable, though not quite the best sour peach nose I have encountered to date. Lovely mix of aromatics here. 5/5

Taste: Peach, peach, peach, mineral water, a hint of stone fruit and a kiss of oak. So lovely. It's 90% peach, with a little jellied sweetness, wine, oak and other faint underlying complexities that make you doubt this is Lost Abbey. Do not get me wrong, Tomme makes some delicious sours, but subtly has never been his calling card. Finishes with lasting peach flavor. Just a hint of vinegar. More acidity/sourness if you let it sit on the tongue more. 4.75

Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied, spot on carbonation. More ""pop"" from the cork than there was with Veritas 010. Soft tartness with a little sweetness. Virtually no acidity and has the delicateness of the best Belgian lambic, which is quite unlike Veritas 010. Excellent balance. 5/5

Overall: A remarkable ghost whale; one of the better white whales out there that I have sampled to date. It is not a unique beer so much as it is a masterfully brewed and balanced one. I would put this a half step above Fuzzy in quality, noting that it is six or so years old and thus likely faded from its peak. I personally would take a bottle like Black & Wild over this if given a choice, but this bottle did not disappoint.

Cost: Unknown (was never a bottle sold to the public).","Aug 14, 2014"
Yellow Bus,,Illinois,4.51/5,"750ml

Yellow Bus had a hazy peach body that glows when backlit but has enough haziness to add some murk, almost like unfiltered cider. A small fizzy white head was all I could manage on a strong pour and crackles down in seconds to absolutely nothing, no collar, no lacing. The body looks extremely appetizing but the lack of any visible head is detrimental to the overall look.

Yellow Bus's aroma is out of this world good! Super acidic, bursting fresh peaches permeates every olfactory gland and nearly gets me high. The funky notes in this brew are right along the lines of Cantillon, having a ton of the same characteristics. Minerally damp rock, cobweb infested musty attic, and tart acid citric notes all bring the raucous with hints at lactic tartness as well, giving of a low level of peaches and cream. Soft oak cradles all the funk and vivid peachy qualities. I could keep my beak in the glass all night long and fall asleep a satisfied man.

This is delicious beer! As good as this tastes I think the aroma was so outstanding it simply can't be touched on the flavor. The peach works it's magic from front to back, and side to side, with puckering tart tendencies. The funk is a little subdued when taking the smell into consideration but still shows all the same aspects. The peaches add some acidic tartness while also adding a touch of sweet, juicy notes overall. This really is an amazing beer!

The body has a medium feel and the carbonation isn't quite as lively as I'd like but I'm also nitpicking here as you can see from my score. A little stickiness hits on the backend while the peach tartness runs along the sides of my tongue. Each sip leaves me parched and immediately reaching for my glass.

The drinkability is simply off the charts. Yellow Bus is sweet, sour, refreshing and complex. I could without a doubt sit around and drink this beer all day long, well, until the heartburn got too bad to take. I had a hard time setting the glass down; it really does just beckon me to drink.

As much as Lost Abbey irritates me I have to say, they can brew some incredible beers and Yellow Bus is one of them, incredible. The white peaches are a tremendous touch to a great base. It's unfortunate the looks took the hit they did as I think the score could easily be higher.","Aug 18, 2013"
Yellow Bus,,New York,4.84/5,"Very interesting story behind these acquisition of YB. Id like to give a big thank you to Tomme and David for authenticating my bottles. They went way out of their way to help me and it is much appreciated

A- Poured from a Tomme Arthur hand signed bottle. Beautiful apricot color with a light ring of head.

N- Peach, peach, peach.... drank next to V004/V010 and the peach in YB was more prominent. Sour notes of vinegar probably from the age. Brett and moldy peach funk

T- Fresh ripe peach as though they were picked yesterday, sour peach skins, light vinegar and brett. moderate funk, with incredibly well balanced sweet/tart characteristics. Peach e o's come to mind

M- smooth with very light carbonation.

O- The best peach sour i have ever had...hands down... My wife drank most of my pour not realizing how rare the yellow bus is. Big thanks to Mark for letting me drink pretty much half of his glass.","Apr 25, 2013"
Yellow Bus,,New York,4.16/5,"Thanks Joel! Poured into LA Teku a hazy light orange, nothing remarkable. Faint peach and a fairly well rounded lactic and acetic punch to those nose. A bit of barnyardy funk, again pretty subtle. Opens with a blast of peach and nectarine, a bit of brine and apple cider vinegar over top of the peach flavor. Finishes very clean. A bit of green apple, but no oxidation. Fruit is more of an after-thought at this point, wish I could have tried this fresh. Very soft with light carbonation. Overall a great american wild, with just a touch of peach character left. This destroys fantasia and is in line with the best bottles of flaming fury I have tried, although the YB certainly has a bit more depth.","Apr 25, 2013"
Yellow Bus,,Pennsylvania,4.28/5,"Thank you Joel! Delicious sour peach, My second time having Yellow Bus; had after Veritas 001 through 011 to my Lost Abbey Teku glass. Super sour, little bit hazy but that I flew up to cloudy noses. All peach sour, really nice, touch acetic and touch lactic, nice even a little bit of green apple and apple skin. Flavored sour with a light rice wine vinegar, peaches, peaches, and peaches. Significantly more sour and significantly less Peach than when I had it about a year and a half ago. A very nice mouthfeel, soft, sensuous touch of carbonation. Very very nice! Thanks, Joel!","Apr 20, 2013"
Yellow Bus,,Georgia,4.59/5,"Tomme was nice enough to share it with me on a visit to the brewery about a year and a half ago. Working off of memory here...

M - Medium bodied

O - An amazing smooth tasty sour brew. Would love for LA to produce this one again...","Mar 29, 2013"
Yellow Bus,,Maryland,4.77/5,"A big thanks to Tomme and crew for surprising us by bringing this to our Lost Abbey tasting. Poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden amber color with not much head to speak of.

Smell: There is a sweetness throughout with strong tart lemon and vinegar notes. I'm also getting a funk from this beer. Very light.

Taste: This is a really tart beer. Lots of lemon and some vinegar notes as well. Quire tart in the finish. I only got a hint of peaches. This beer is extremely refreshing on such a hot day.

Mouthfeel: Medium body with smooth tingly carbonation and and an extremely dry finish.

Overall: This beer was so light and refreshing. I loved the lemon notes. Just fantastic.","Jul 02, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,District of Columbia,4.48/5,"Bottled shared by Tomme at the massive Lost Abbey tasting. Served alongside Veritas 004 and 010 (the other LA peach sours) because we are assholes. 

This beer looks fantastic - I usually don't get super excited about the way a beer looks, but something about this one just screamed PEACH - it was a hazy golden-orange with a thin white head. Smell is primarily lactic sour and oak, but there's certainly still some peach here which is pretty damn impressive given the age. Flavor is (shocking) sour peach, though it's not incredibly peachy like V004 was. It's quite sour, and I'd say my only complaint, and it's a minor one, is that it's a little too acidic. There are some vinegar notes here which keep it from being a perfect beer to me, which indicates that it might be a little past it's prime at this point. Mouthfeel is light-medium body with a great spritziness. Overall, this beer is fantastic, but consumed right next to Veritas 004, which was sublime, you see what it might've been a couple of years ago. Even past its prime, this is one of the best sours out there and I'm so psyched I had a chance to try it.","Jul 02, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,Virginia,4.92/5,"Tomme Arthur delivered this beer to my front door. Yes, I am serious. Poured into a mini snifter. RIDE THE BUS.

A - Medium golden hue with a lot of haze from the dredges. Very slight carbonation that recedes to the edge of the glass and disappears.

S - Wow. Still a ton of fresh cut peaches, mostly the skin of the peach. Good lactic smell as well.

T - Incredible. Still a bunch of peach pit in this beer. Light acidity that blends perfectly with peach.

M - Light spritzy and unbelievable drinkable. The sourness lingers well through the finish. The peach coats the back sides of my tongue.

O - I don't know what to say. This is the best experience I've ever hard in regards to beer. And this wasn't the only bottle he bought.","Jul 01, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,California,4.05/5,"Sufficiently lucky to have attended the DC Lambic & Sour Tasting on April 14, 2012 although I've not posted my reviews/notes until doing a couple today.

I here give a brief review for the primary purpose of stating that I've found great varience in bottles.

Summary review:

Pours a light diluted yellow with a thin white head. 

Nose is typical sour/lambic tart but, this is the first bottle of a few that I've tried that actually still had a hint (and, yes...just a hint) of peaches. Some funk and tartness in the nose. Nice.

The flavor profile here is generally on many of the more recent tasting, in my opinion, more ""wishful thinking"" than reality, although perhaps you ""younger drinkers"" simply have a better palate than me. In my opinon, there is no question that this beer is very over the hill - not gone but clearly nothing like it was when produced. Past experience has led me to make the above conclusion with a fervor. Here, in this bottle, there actually was a hint of peach and fruit, something I've found to be uncharacteristic in the bottles I've tried the past two years. This bottle was much better than the bottle I provided to our California tasting last year (and yet I know that it was from the same source).

Nice mouthfeel, nice flavors and all around decent to drink. I never tasted it fresh and about which I'm sorry since I think it must have been terrific. However, in the words of Tommee Arthur at the Extreme Beer Festival over two years ago...""It's way past it's prime and nothing like it was."" I can't comment on that part! But, a nice experience for what it was with this particular bottle.","May 26, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,Maryland,4.5/5,"Thanks to Brad for sharing this beer at the DC sour tasting. Served in a Lost Abbey Teku glass because this was my only opportunity to drink this beer, might as well do it in style.

Beer is yellow and mildly hazy with a lazy white head, wispy, attracted to the glass, some lacing, moderate carbonation, looks really good.

There was some debate about how much peach was left in the aroma but I picked it out immediately. It is mildly acetic, tart, nice peach aroma without being overwhelming. Strong, sour finish.

Beer is light in body and quite tart on the back end. Some odd bitterness at the finish, mildly dry on the backend as well. Strong beer, forward in bite and brightness. Nice carbonic and lactic acid with hints of citrus and a mild funk at the end. An awesome beer for sure. Thanks again.","Apr 19, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,New York,4.57/5,"From 04/14/12. Huge huge thanks to ygtbsm94 for sharing this one; thanks Brad! A beer I never thought I'd get to try.

a - Pours a murky dark orange color with one inch of white head and low carbonation evident.

s - Smells of sour peaches, and light fruits, fruity malts, brett, light funk, fruity malts. A ton of fruit which surprised me given the age, and some light funk. Very nice nose.

t - Tastes of sour peaches, sour fruity malts, light fruits, oak, funk, brett. Taste is more tart then the nose and a step up for me.

m - Medium body and low carbonation. Easy to drink sour.

o - Overall I thought this was a great beer. I was struck by how much fruit was still in the nose and taste. The nose had some nice light funk and the taste had more sour peaches. Much better then Synergy, though I preferred DDG and Izzy to this one.","Apr 18, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,District of Columbia,4.82/5,"Bottle shared by ygtbsm94 at our insane sour ale tasting last weekend. Thanks Brad.

The beer appears golden yellow hued with a thin white head. To my delight and surprise, the aroma brings the pleasant scent of peaches. The flavor takes it up a level, with a perfect blend of tart acidity, peaches, and Lost Abbey funk. Simply delicious. This was an instant favorite for me. Light in body, this was highly drinkable. This certainly lived up to the hype and high expectations. I only hope that Tomme brews this again.","Apr 18, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,Illinois,4.25/5,"Bottle at the DC Lambic & Sour Tasting on April 14, 2012. Served in a Lost Abbey Teku. Huge thanks to Brad for bringing this one out.

Pours a cloudy yellow-golden color with a thin white head. Decent retention and a few spots of lacing as it goes down.

The nose carries a moderate amount of peaches with some backing acidity and general fruitiness. A bit of earthiness there as well. Mild Brett funk.

The flavor kicks it up a notch with a really deep peach flavor that could clearly only come from the fruit of a single tree. Even after all these years, it's quite clear that a mythical tree alone could have produced such wondrous fruit. Oops, I was wrong -- this tastes like yellow peaches. The kind you can buy at any farmers market. Probably not from a shitty grocery store, though. I'll give them that.

After wading through the peach mystery, I got some light funk and moderate-to-heavy acidity with average carbonation and a light body with a dry finish.

Overall, this was quite good. I didn't like it as much as the Isabelle we had beside it, though it was more-intensely fruity. Overall, quite good, though not quite a to-do-for creation.","Apr 18, 2012"
Yellow Bus,,California,3.92/5,"750ml bottle, signed by Tomme Arthur himself, enjoyed during a game of beirut a.k.a. beer pong (I'm not joking), but mostly from a separate Lost Abbey glass rather than the red Solo cups. I honestly think the awesome force of rarity in this beer propelled me to sink the last cup in a stunning come-from-behind victory that had the crowd in awe (we were down like 7 to 2 at one point), and for that I have Tomme to thank.

Clear peachy orange color with a small white head. A bit less yellow than a bus.

The aroma is nice, rather peachy with other light fruit notes - apricot and pear in particular. Rather funky with nice oak barrel notes.

The flavor is nice if a bit subdued. Peach is fairly assertive, and there is some citrus/lemon. The sourness is restrained and there is actually a touch of sweetness in it. Tastes good, and rare. Medium oakiness.

Medium-bodied with carbonation a little on the lower side. Fairly long finish.

Overall, this is a very good beer, but maybe not quite worth the hype behind it. Maybe it's faded a bit - who knows. I'm rating this objectively so I'll refrain from the ""A++++ BEST BEER EVER OMG"" schtick. Thanks a lot to all who made this happen though. This is truly one of the highlights of my ticking career.","Oct 17, 2011"
Consecration,,Pennsylvania,4.2/5,"Served from a tap in a clear pint glass, it's modest biege head didn't last long. The brew is a deep brown-amber, almost mahogany, bright and surprisingly clear for all the color. The only aroma is that almost woody sourness common to good barrel aged ales. The barrel tannins dominate even the Brettanomyces and currants to taste. no minor feat. Yet, the taste is complex enough that they can be specifically detected. There are too many sours that are really some degree of tart. This is also a little tart, but it's unmistakably sour. The woody tannins linger a little too long in the aftertaste. Other than that, there's no complaint here. The high ABV isn't noticed, the taste is full and complex, delivered within a body that's rich for the style.","Jun 23, 2023"
Consecration,,Indiana,4/5,Good sour and barrel flavors.,"May 06, 2023"
Consecration,,Washington,3.01/5,"375mL cork-topped bottle, bottled on 090622 and served in a stemless CBC glass. Brilliant ruby color with great clarity and little head. Inhaling through my nose I get hit with a powerful whallop of sourness. Oh boy. Yes, the flavor is sour too. It's more balanced than I would have given it credit for based on the aroma and the first sip. But it's fizzy and tart without much flavor, to my palate. I don't get fruit, I don't get wine barrel. I don't get chocolate or tobacco or any of the other flavors printed on the label. But I also don't get ethanol, and at 10% ABV, that's really saying something.

I feel compelled to finish this beer but please, take it away from me.","Apr 22, 2023"
Consecration,,Ohio,4.34/5,"Look - brownish orange with an initial head, fizz

Consecration,,Maine,4.44/5,"Vintage 10/24/19 - poured into a cabernet stem at ~50°F

Pours a deep garnet-copper hue, beautifully translucent, and with not a spot of foam or rim. Some slow, lazy bubbles meander up, but otherwise, appears nearly still. 4.75

Nose: Right from the start, this is a balanced aroma. The base of warm, toasty, semi-sweet grain is apparent, forming a lively clean platform for the sharp characteristics. Plenty of bright dark fruit currant flair, with notes of plum, overrule cherry, prune, and even a bit of jammy red fruit. That cabernet cask is front and center, with lots of cab, and lots of cask. 4.5

Palate: Consecration hits the palate with, in typical Russian River fashion, a full on velvet assault. That is, the ale is incredibly bold and boisterous, yet it's done so with such deft balance and nuance. The wild culture acidic is so perfect - bretty and dry, with the acetic nature really softened, allowing the subtler complexities to shine. The currant is vague on the nose, but here, they distinguish themselves from other dark fruit. Tart, tangy, and tannic, which accents the microbes wonderfully. The cabernet casks, again, are just so dialed in, right there. Deep, dense, peppery wine-stained oak, complimenting those currants. Between the cultures, you get a zip from the pedio, but in the spotlight is the brett - that dusty, musty, drying tannic bitter funk - reaching a prominent but fitting peak, before letting off, and really allowing that clean, simple, semi-sweet grainy base to take over, concluding with a bit of bread crust on an exhale of intense cabernet and bretty black currant. 4.5


Mouthfeel/Body: Really lovely feel here. Yes, it's a bit on the lazy side. Not still - there's definitely some life here, but it's loose and sparse. However, at 10% ABV, it drinks exceedingly well and fluid. Not syrupy at all. Quite crisp, while still having some heft. 4.25

Overall: I think this is great. The complexity here is quite surprising. There's just a lot of depth and nuance. This seems to be a theme with RRBC wild ales, from what I've tried. This, though, captures this trifecta of complex nuance, super present wine cask and fruit character, and remarkable balance. It's a bit tannic, and packs a semi-bitter bite, but there's so much to unpack. That's just an additional layer. Just so juicy and dense. Consecration? Should be called Concentration! This one is seriously bold, intense, and bursting at the seams. A lovely bottle, and quite fitting for this Thanksgiving's pour. Well done. 4.25","Nov 24, 2022"
Consecration,,,4.54/5,"Incredible. Best sour ale on the market. Beautiful cabernet flavor with notes of raspberry, oak, currant, blackberry, and orange. It's as complex as wine while still being beer. I hope they offer it in more stores.","Sep 10, 2022"
Consecration,,Washington,4.46/5,"Poured from a 12.68 ounce bottle dated 11/5/20 into a snifter.

Look- Amber brown, clear, no visible particulate, fine cream colored head, below average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Very fragrant, black currant, tobacco, plum, blackberry, black cherry, brett, oak, black licorice.

Taste- Black currant, black pepper, brett, plum, blackberry, black cherry, transitions during the sip from sweet/sour to just sour.

Feel- Between medium and full body, very mouth watering upfront, highly dry at finish, soft, silky, sour finish, moderately mouth coating, below average carbonation.

Overall- Highly complex beer with an abundance of flavor and a powerful bouquet. Nice balance of plum, black currant, blackberry, and black cherry made for a wonderful experience.","Aug 21, 2022"
Consecration,,Michigan,4.39/5,"Received via NBS BIF #13 from @Jayorear.
Poured brown with tints of red, the beige head grew to about 1 cm and settled to a thin film leaving no lacing.
Aroma had red wine vinegar and, oddly, red wine (I mean, how do they get both of those aromas to come through?) 
The taste, wow. Oak, funky red wine vinegar and, at the edges, dry red wine. Faint but unmistakable. The flavors play off each other in every sip.
The feel is medium with very active carbonation. Fits well with the flavors.
Thanks Jay, this was amazing!","Jul 09, 2022"
Consecration,,Washington,4.41/5,"Re-reviewing this one (7/1/2022) now that I have an additional decade of beer tasting experience (and, consequently, several additional pounds) under my belt.

375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.

Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.

Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious. 

Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing. 

Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

Aroma is tart cidery funk w/ bright notes of sour fruit and oak. A slight solvent aroma lingers.

Taste is tart, sour, oaky and fruity. Lots of wine notes, really dry on the palate. Almost a combination of a lambic, cabernet, and champagne. Really interesting beer to pick apart; complex.

Consecration,,West Virginia,4.31/5,"375ml bottle, tulip, bottled 2/26/20. 

There’s a little fizz as I pour, but my attention quickly shifts to the eye catching dark amber liquid. It has a viscose appearance, bubbles move slower, like a hardening piece of amber, and there’s a notable lack of foam. 

It’s funky, naturally. Lacto sourness, copper, and the currants come through with their gamey, deep fruitiness. 

Moderate tartness before moving on to a schmorgasbord of funk, leather, barrel, dry red wine, and those delicious little berries. 

Light body, practically no carbonation, and just a little slick. 

When I picked this bottle up last year I was surprised I hadn’t had Consecration. It’s just a super well done beer.","May 13, 2022"
Consecration,,Michigan,4.21/5,"Brief Review:

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.

Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better.","May 04, 2022"

Beer poured a red wine color with a fizzy carbonated head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is cherry and strawberry forward and red wine barrel that gives a touch of leather.

Consecration,,Massachusetts,4.5/5,"Bottled 7/12/21

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather

Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%

Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall","Mar 13, 2022"
Consecration,,New Jersey,4.5/5,"Reddish brown liquid, off-white, slightly pinkish head that diminishes quickly. Dark fruit and oak fills the flavor profile, derivative of the Cabernet aging.

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel.
T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.
M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience.","Nov 06, 2021"

Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present. 

The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical. 

The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky. 

The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish. 

This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!","Aug 27, 2021"

Consecration,,Nevada,4.78/5,"What else can you say about this? Lively, funky, bright, full flavored, complex, refreshing... This is a great sour ale with a beautiful amber russet color. Carbonation is moderate and provides nice effervescence. The taste follows the nose perfectly with currant and bretty funkiness. So easy to drink at 10% abv. No real rough edges here.

*Taste: BEST. Oaky, leather, sour, black current, subtle cabernet wine notes, malty but super light/refreshing. Not heavy by any means. Super super easy to drink! Be careful with this since the drinkability is out of the charts and hides 10% alcohol so well. This is the best American Sour/Wild Ale that gives the world-class Belgian Sour Ales a run for their money! Although expensive at $15.99 a bottle, this Beer is not to be missed by any Beer lover. The alcohol at 10% is so damn well hidden. As the great JR from the erstwhile WWF would put” By God! This is the best American Beer.

Lots of sourness and barnyard notes in the first sip. Pineapple juice in there too. Sweet berry notes add excellent balance but things are still bone dry overall. The 10% abv is shockingly well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with prickly, champagne like carbonation.

A stellar wild ale from the OG producer. Complex, nuanced yet still dangerously quaffable. A must try.","Jul 11, 2020"
Consecration,,California,4.67/5,"L: Brilliant clear amber brown in color with a light lace.

S: Very fragrant, powerful scents of funky sour cherries, grapes and plum.

As you wait for it, a smooth transition of flavors move towards the rear and to the sides of your tongue as you saliva glands get seduced. Flavors of sour cherries, nectarines, kumquats, apricots and plum emerge and give way to more complex flavors of oak, black pepper and tobacco as it stimulates your salivary glands, drying your mouth and making you thirst for more.

Consecration,,New Jersey,4.21/5,"Consecration - 9/17/2015

Look: Pours translucent and murky medium brown. Auburn and chestnut in the light. A beige colored head that disappears with a thin ring of foam around the edge of the glass. No lacing and no visible carbonation.

Smell: The aroma is floral, powdery, perfumey and musty. A lot of wood. Fresh currant, cherry and blackberry. Citrus acidity and a faint amount of some apple cider vinegar.

Taste: Sweet and sour. A hint of apple cider vinegar. Some cinnamon spice. Some berry flavored chocolate. Some pithy bitterness. The acidity level is medium for me. 

Feel: Very smooth and low carbonation. Some more effervescence would help. Not sure if it’s flattened out a bit over time or not. Sweeter up front and dry on the finish. 

Overall: You’d never know this beer is 10% other than feeling the alcohol. No alcohol on the aroma of taste. Definitely has some red wine similarities, but also many aspects from the mixed fermentation that you’d not expect in red wine. It’s really delicious.","Apr 25, 2020"

Permanent Funeral,,California,4.04/5,"Can dated 10-04-2021

Appearance: Fairly cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. Nothing to change here.

Smell: Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas. There is a bit of malty aromas also present.

Taste: Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness. The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAs/IIIPAs hit 10% or more ABV. The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Overall: A good IIPA but too high in ABV for my personal tastes for an IPA/IIPA. I just find the malt sweetness a bit much in hop centric beers over 9.5% or so.","Mar 11, 2022"
Permanent Funeral,,Virginia,3.46/5,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 10/04/21 Q0433""

Appearance: It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it. The head is large, thick, and white. The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapioca-like bubbles. It has very good retention and lacing.

Aroma: There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy. As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok.

Taste: The flavor kind-of mimics the aroma; up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral. Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor. It finishes slightly floral.

Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great. The beer has a medium-light pithy hop bitterness. The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth. Drinkability is high.

Overall: The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer. The can states that this is a ""ALC 10.5% BY VOL"" and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content. The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting. It isn't the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability.

Permanent Funeral,,Tennessee,4.4/5,"Picked this up at Hy-vee in Owatonna Minnesota. No canned on date. 
Appearance: Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment. Almost 3 fingers of snow-white foam. Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates. 
Smell: Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind. Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot. Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness. As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness. 

Taste: Holy Hops! Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds. On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone. Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips. More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange, mango, guava, melon, and lemon. Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness. Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present, but the malt character is underwhelming. 

Feel: Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness. Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness, but this beer seems to have both. Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms. 

Overall: This beer is solid, very complex and a lot of good flavors, but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show. Also pretty expensive at $14 for a 4-pack of tall boys. I don’t think I would buy it again, but if it was offered to me I wouldn't turn it down and I’m glad I tried it.","Dec 22, 2021"

So here we are, the highest rated American Porter on BA, the legendary Hill Farmstead Everett! This is awesome to finally get my hands on a long time want of mine, not to mention I get the pleasure of trying this just 3 days after canning. Let’s crack it open and find out what all the hype is about

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of dark tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh yeah, the nose displays such a wonderful balance between roast and sweetness, I love it. I’m picking up on aromas of medium roast coffee, milk chocolate, brown sugar, earthy hops, raisin, dark toast, light toffee, vanilla, and black pepper

It really upholds the aroma in taste, though maybe a tad less sweet. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting drip coffee, dark bread, brown sugar, honey, milk chocolate, raisin, vanilla, light caramel, and earthy hops. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, molasses, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, raisin, dark toast, vanilla, toffee, and earthy hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet sharp beer. Finishes bone dry and roasty

This is everything I was hoping it would be. Wonderfully balanced and smooth, yet drinks well under its abv. I’m so glad I ended up getting 8 of these","Dec 23, 2022"
Everett,,Kiribati,3.63/5,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one from his strike during NBS BIF #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) Poured into 16oz tulip. Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing.

The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops.

Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops.

The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered.

Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time.

Overall, a very nicely done brew. A must-try if you get the chance.","Apr 13, 2022"
Everett,,Connecticut,4.4/5,"Canned on 10/12/21 (best before 1/12/22); consumed on 1/19/22

Pours a glossy jet-brown body with chocolate/chestnut hues and capped with two fingers of rich, light mocha foam; excellent head retention leaves a slim layer of frothy cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a near-comprehensive coating of mounded, webby lacing caked across the walls of the glass.

Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close.

Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish.

Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium.","Jan 20, 2022"
Everett,,Maryland,4.59/5,"Look: opaque, dark chestnut brown, bordering on black. Slightly viscous ringing when swirled; thick, tight carbonation.
Smell: lots of cocoa, coffee, toffee and brown sugar. 
Taste: absolutely incredible! Perfectly balanced with a nutty malt backbone that stops just short of drifting into stout territory. 
Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary. Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable.
Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while. Would definitely seek this out as a winter-warmer, or after dinner drink. Best of all, the ABV is manageable and leaves room for another glass.","Jan 08, 2022"

The taste is outstanding. Intense and complex. Dark chocolate, charred wood, malts, licorice, burnt toffee, dark roast coffee, and a bitter smoky flavor that becomes more intense on the aftertaste. Very smooth and well integrated. I really dig this one. Not surprised by the great ratings!

Creamy, almost like milk, chocolate. Not very sweet though. No coffee. 

Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Lower carbonation. There's a bit more bitterness than the smell suggests but it seems to come from hops not black patent malt as there's no burnt elements of coffee flavors. Rich sweet to semisweet chocolate flavor before the bitterness comes from the swallow.","Nov 26, 2021"
Everett,,Massachusetts,4.93/5,"Poured from a fresh can into a tulip glass:

Appearance: really dark brown, verging on black, with mahogany lights. Thick beige head. Plenty of retention and lacing, with fairly persistent head. 

Very roasty, warm and inviting with multiple layers of aroma: light milk chocolate underlain by mellow coffee.

Taste follows the nose: deep base of roasted malt, with some bitter chocolate. Coffee notes are very mellow with a hint of vanilla and hazlenut. 

Medium-bodied with light carbonation and really nice mouthfeel. Quite a clean finish for a porter.with a relatively crisp finish for a porter. 

Overall: Wow! A benchmark porter. The depth of flavour is incredible for a beer with no adjuncts at this ABV. Combined with lovely mouthfeel and a fantastic finish this is truly a world class porter.","Nov 10, 2021"

Hill Farmstead Brewery
Date: 18 May 2021
I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful. 

Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic. I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note. 

Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate. 

The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness. 

The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish. 

One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness.","Oct 10, 2021"

Everett,,Pennsylvania,4.24/5,"Everett from Hill Farmstead Brewing. Received in early June 2021 in Ninja box from @Roy_Hobbs. 16 oz can stored at home at 42 degrees. Reviewed 1/7/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Bottom rim stamped “CANNED 05/18/21 DRINK BY 09/18/21”. Served at 53.0 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.6 degrees. 
Appearance – 4.5.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), clear. 
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, opaque but translucent amber brown at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density initially but quickly opening, average retention, diminishing to leave a 0.7 to 1.0 cm lacy crown and a thin complete cap. An archipelago of foam islands resembling coral atolls remains on the sides of the glass above the crown. Second pour produces a dense 0.7 cm head. 
Lacing – Fair. Wide band of tiny bubbles, separating into two bands, with short, blunt, stalactites. See also above.
Aroma – 4.25 – Begins with roasted malt and cocoa, no hops, no yeast, no coffee.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins slightly sweet with roasted malt and cocoa and a hint of coffee, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Slight gastric warming does occur. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends slightly bitter.
Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation. 
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter.","Jul 01, 2021"
Everett,,New Jersey,4.52/5,"I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking.","May 30, 2021"
Everett,,Pennsylvania,5/5,"From a growler filled at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia, poured immediately into a tulip glass.

Look-
Chocolate, deep deep brown but not quite black. Nice, chocolate-brown head, about 1.5 inches thick.

Smell-
Roasted goodness. Nutty, chocolatey, coffeey. Just all the great things about fall, roasted in a perfect blend.

Taste-
The best blend of coffee-chocolate-nut roast I have ever experienced in any dining experience. Simply unbelievable, everything is roasted perfectly in their own right--no burn chocolate or coffee taste, nothing is lost or overpowers. Absurd.

Feel-
Stouty without being thick or cumbersome. Could easily drink the 64 oz growler in one evening, as it is lighter than expected given the taste and abv.

Overall-
My favorite beer. Ever. Hands down. Just...unreal blend of flavors and roasting profiles everything is simply astonishing.","Apr 28, 2020"
Everett,,Connecticut,4.75/5,"The roast profile on this beer is almost unbelievable before even considering it's limited at 7.2% abv. Bittersweet chocolate, city dark roast coffee grounds, and charcoal suggests a grittiness that swirls within a medium-full body that never cloys nor removes focus from the flavor. Tough to tell where roast ends and hops begin, both giving tremendous depth of flavor. 

I am most impressed with the light smoke/kindling character that comes through subtly on the finish, almost just an olfactory sensation. It really takes the roast flavor and overall experience over the top. In the style, I've had nothing that comes close","Feb 28, 2020"

Triple Citra Daydream,,Massachusetts,4.54/5,"Canning date obstructed

Tavour has hooked me up with the highest rated Milkshake IPA on BA, and it’s from Other Half no less. I’m very excited to try this one knowing the quality that Other Half consistently pushes out. Let’s get right into it

Pours a hazy milky yellow with 3 fingers of dense off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

The nose has such a nice snap here, but there’s still a rounded softness to it. I’m picking up on aromas of orange juice, pineapple juice, grassy hops, bready malt, red grapefruit, white pepper, sweet vanilla, lychee, dank weed, and light mango

It keeps up that same balance of smooth with a bite in taste as well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting underripe mango, orange juice, resinous hops, bready malt, pineapple juice, dank weed, light grass, and red grapefruit. The swallow brings notes of orange juice, sweet vanilla, bready malt, pineapple juice, resinous hops, lemon zest, underripe mango, light lychee, white pepper, and grass

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a silky and juicy beer. Finishes mostly dry and drinks well below its abv

This is awesome stuff. I’m glad I got ab extra can, and it’s one I’ll likely pick up every time I see it on Tavour or if I ever get to try it on tap","May 31, 2023"

Looks like orange juice with heavy foam on top. Taste is all Citra, all orange juice, but with accents of vanilla and creamcicle milkshake. The alcohol is not invisible and makes itself known. It gets a bit sweet and cloying as it sits. It is a bit of a sugary headache in a can, which is a ding in an otherwise great beer. Still very enjoyable.

Triple Citra Daydream,,Massachusetts,4.34/5,"Canned a month ago. Brooklyn. 

L -- Pours golden yellow in the glass with a finger of sudsy off-white head produced with fairly aerated pour. Good retention and some lacing
S -- This is one of those IPAs you can smell from halfway across the room. Orange juice concentrate, kumquat, yellow grapefruit, creamsicle, hint of dankness
T -- Again, citrus of all sorts dominates here (not surprisingly). There's a decent creamy sweetness from the lactose and a neutral malt character from the oat and wheat. Perhaps most impressive is the complete lack of booziness despite the high ABV. It's a bit one dimensional, but nothing offensive
F -- Soft, fluffy, creamy. Kinda Tree House-like, actually

Triple Citra Daydream,,Germany,4.93/5,"3 months old. Can to wine glass.

L: Pours a milky yellow with a fluffy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

S: Candied citrus fruits, sweet white grapes, ripe strawberries and bubblegum.

T: Tastes exactly as it smells. The citrus notes are a bit more defined here, focusing mostly on orange and tangerine. Following the fruity, bubblegummy body, the finish is slightly bitter.

F: Very full. Very creamy. Quite smooth and almost soft despite it‘s high ABV. Medium carbonation.

O: In my experience, Other Half’s higher ABV IPAs often age very nicely as they tend to smooth out after a few weeks losing most of their boozy sweetness. This one marks no exception. At three months old, it has developed into an absolute world class IPA. It‘s still on the sweet side, but in a very pronounced and complex way showcasing both the hop variety and the beer style in an outstanding way.","Oct 19, 2022"
Triple Citra Daydream,,New York,4.79/5,"Appearance: Triple Citra Daydream is a hazy golden-yellow beer with a frothy white head. The beer has moderate to high clarity, with a moderate amount of carbonation visible.

Aroma: On the nose, this beer has a strong citrus aroma, primarily composed of grapefruit, tangerine, and orange notes. There are also hints of pine and a slight malty sweetness.

Taste: The taste of Triple Citra Daydream is consistent with its aroma, with strong citrusy hop flavors dominating. There is a medium to high bitterness that is balanced out by the beer's sweet malt backbone. The grapefruit, tangerine, and orange flavors are prominent, and there are also notes of pine.

Mouthfeel: This beer has a medium to full body with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is moderate to high, which adds to the beer's overall refreshing quality.

Overall Impression: Overall, Triple Citra Daydream is a well-balanced and highly drinkable IPA. Its strong citrus flavors, balanced bitterness, and smooth mouthfeel make it an excellent choice for hop-forward beer fans. It is a beer that would be best enjoyed fresh, either on its own or with a light snack.","Oct 09, 2022"

Nose is citric orange; grass; melon, double bubble . Flavor mirrors with more noticeable apricot tartness and some banana like richness coming through as well. 
Body is velvety smooth only lightly carbonated. Rich but not heavy or sluggish. Not for everyone but spot on in my wheel house. Seems almost hand pulled from cask. Absolutely no double digit ABV noticeable at all. Mastercrafting here.

Triple Citra Daydream,,Florida,4.18/5,"Poured a golden-orange body with two-finger head that slowly died and left a lace ring down the glass. Aroma struck me as a mix of mild grapefruit and citric hops along with smidge of tropical fruits and floral notes. Fuller-bodied, slightly sticky, a touch of booze and maltiness in the beer but mostly a tropical fruit sweetness that balances with a floral hoppiness and then a touch of citric zip on the finish. Great balance between different aspects and well-hidden booze make this an enjoyable beer.","Nov 17, 2021"

Crazy, ridiculous long lasting head and thick lacing. Really something else for a beer of this ABV. Super green hops and sweaty gym clothes followed by bubble gum, berries, mango.....

Congress Street IPA,,Texas,3.06/5,"Canned on 7/19/23

A: Pours with a near opaque cloudiness. A dense white head rises with good retention and lace. Manageable to pour if you go slow.
S: Some sweet fruits, most people are saying pineapple. Sure, I guess I can go with that. I don't know if these kinds of NEIPA's overwhelm me to a point were I just can't pick anything out, cause I don't get near the expressive fruity/hops aromas as others. Its just vaguely there.
T: Yep, sweet and fruity. Like store bought Dole juice to me. I don't get anything in the finish, but some hop burn...or alcohol can't figure it out...
M/O: I guess I can't be too hard, but just muddled to me. Low carbonation, sticky sweet, no finish, some kind of astringency. Either from hop burn or alcohol burn. This is going to be a chore to finish.

Every once in a while, I like to revisit styles I'm not the biggest fan of, especially when a hyped brewery pops up in my area. To see if or how my tastes change. Well, this is a style I have yet to really enjoy. Some will say ""don't review styles you don't like"" but I'm just trying to see what everyone but me seems to like...oh well.","Aug 05, 2023"

Congress Street IPA,,California,4.31/5,"Can poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a light layer and laces nicely. 

S: Ripe tropical and stone fruit jump out first, followed by bright citrus and resinous pine, grassy notes, biscuity malt, and a little caramel sweetness. 

T: Punchy, resinous, citrus, grapefruit, orange/tangerine, lemon, and lime, pine, underlying tropical and stone fruit, slightly under ripe pineapple, passion fruit, apricot, peach, and mango, fairly grassy, biscuity malt, and a little caramel sweetness. 

M: Medium body, slightly prickly moderate carbonation, pretty crisp yet also slightly soft on the palate. You can sense a raised acidity from how heavily they hopped it, but there's virtually no perceptible hop burn. Impressive.

O: I've had a few chances to try some of the heavy hitter OG NEIPAs from back East and I think I'm slowly starting to understand them better. Instead of being juice bombs like the majority of the hazies out here, they build off a softer malt body, but still brew an IPA and bring the IBUs and hop intensity. Personally, I wouldn't mind just a touch more sweetness to help counter the intensity of the Columbus, but what do I know? Still quite enjoyable. Really glad I was able to get my hands on a can.","Dec 21, 2022"

Congress Street IPA,,Virginia,4.42/5,"07/06/22. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.

A: Murky Arnold Palmer hue with 1-finger foamy white head with below average retention and spotty lacing.

S: Blasts of lemon, lime, guava, mango, peach, grapefruit, and orange with an herbal, honeysuckle note and a bit of malt sweetness. Esters are moderate and candy-fruity in nature.

T: Unapologetic flavor assault with lemon, lime, guava, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, and definite notes of honeysuckle and marijuana in the late palate and aftertaste. Esters are a little lower in intensity in the flavor but add the same candied fruit notes as the aroma. Bitterness is low-medium and alcohol is well-hidden. Delicious hazy IPA.

M: Medium-bodied with more dry finish than most NEIPAs.

Congress Street IPA,,District of Columbia,4.06/5,"Looks like watered down orange juice with opaque body and a medium collar of white bubbles. Nose is vaguely citrusy before a swirl. After, I get a punch of OJ when I first did this. Later attempts paired that scent with some floral tropical notes and an earthy bitterness.

First taste was earthy and very bitter, but that seemed an anomaly after a few more of them. It remained a bitter beer, but some balance returned. After some sips, the earthy to dirty nature wasn’t completely shook and firmed the base. Hints of grapefruit and orange rind act as lead-ins to pine in the form of both wood and dark green needles.

The evolution of this beer isn’t much, it’s pretty straightforward earthy and bitter to my palate.","Aug 04, 2022"

Smell - The nose was initially fruity, but the bitterness came forward later.

Taste - The taste was initially pretty mild with notes of papaya and mango. The profile shifted to bitter lemon rind and pine notes. A light bready backbone was present. In many ways, it was like drinking liquid lemon rind. The bitterness of the lemon lingered. This tasted like a take-no-prisoners west coast IPA.

Mouthfeel - The body was huge, cloudy like a NEIPA. Carbonation was somewhat smothered by the body.

The tangerine flavor is forward on the taste, and the mango and passion flavors really shine, but the star for me is the biscuity malt flavor, which proves nice balance to the significantly magnificent hop flavors.

The mouthfeel is a bit on the dry side, which I love - this actually sits more on the WCIPA side of the ledger than it does on the NEIPA side, IMHO, which is fine by me.","Nov 07, 2020"

Affogato,,Virginia,4.16/5,"2020 release. Released a month or so ago.

A: Pours black, kinda thin, with a smattering of dark brown head that recedes quickly to a razor thin ring. No lacing or retention to speak of.

S: Medium roast coffee in the forefront, modest amount of dark roastiness and vanilla bark, a bit of cola and chocolate.

T: Moderately sweet milk chocolate and coffee, sharp almost tannic roast, a bit of vanilla extract. Not much complexity, really.

M: A bit on the thin side, with medium, sharp carbonation. Light alcohol burn. 

O: Decent effort but nothing to write home about.","Nov 06, 2020"
Affogato,,West Virginia,4.31/5,"Taken from notes- Feb 2018
750ml Bottle poured into a snifter

Pours deep black in color with a creamy khaki head that has good retention. Smells of bold roasted aromas, giving notes of earthy and herbal coffee, toasted nuts, cracked pepper and dark chocolate. Tastes is initially sweet, with notes of vanilla cream and caramel, followed by bold roasted coffee that gives notes of dark chocolate, toasted walnuts and earthy green coffee. Lingers of vanilla cream and espresso. Medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly creamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish","Nov 04, 2020"
Affogato,,Ohio,4.59/5,"Coffee black, albeit opaque, with a short but dense creamy mocha head that retains as a thin but fluffy blanket until dying to just a curled ring.

The super round, lusciously fluffy medium-full body delivers creamy fresh vanilla whip swirled into the smooth presence of medium roast coffee exhibiting big punches of dark chocolate morsels all gliding along a tingly carbonation that recedes into a just semi-dry finish. The longer I dig in, the chocolatier and fluffier it gets, developing further hints of mocha liqueur and crystalized toffee or even peanut brittle, while also becoming a little sticky on the lips. 

There's a little bit of a charred brown sugar element you might experience in Mexican coffee, and as the lactose builds on the palate it becomes tough to drink, even splitting the bottle with my old lady.

I just couldn't wait to duo dome this bottle with her as fresh as possible after this b2 release, and it was not a disappointment. There's no question why this beer set off Trillium's pastry stout odyssey, as this b2 is no slouch and still the best pastry stout they've put out (with Biscotti & Coffee and BA Affogato being my other tops).","Nov 03, 2020"
Affogato,,Massachusetts,3.83/5,"This is a review for the 2020 version that was dropped for a day. I am sure this will get great reviews as with everything Trillium but I think most good breweries brew better. Perhaps this ages better.

Looks great. Dark, creamy, little head that dissipates soon enough. For an ""affogato"" it sets some expectations.

Smells Good. Yes, you get the coffee, chocolate and vanilla but the smell gives you the first hint that this is going to be a disappointment. Stouts with lesser alcohol smell better and there are many good coffee and chocolate stouts out there. 

First taste is really good. The smell has muted your expectations. The vanilla is there, the coffee not so much. I am guessing they do that to get a better audience but this is an ""affogato"" with a blend of coffee. There's more of chocolate notes so that's a plus. The aftertaste is too sugary though. By the second sip, a pint seems like a lot but I have been served at the brewery and the taste doesn't live up. Probably needs less alcohol with less sugar and more of a mouthfeel to get a better balance and flavor profile.

I can see that this was a great beer when it was introduced a few years ago but it needs an update. The limited drop is a great way to get good ratings. Try this if you are in the Boston area. If you are making a trip, head to Wakefield in the opposite direction instead. Your local brewery probably makes a better pastry stout.","Oct 24, 2020"

Affogato,,Massachusetts,4.4/5,"Split the 750ml bottle two ways; chilled out in my fridge since the release. Not sure if some of the sweetness and coffee flavor was subdued by Father Time but, if it was, that only would've made the beer taste that much better to my pillow-soft palate. Heavily flavored stouts, especially big coffee brews, taste cloying and acidic. I was fully prepared for this beast to be over-the-top sticky and sweet but it turned out to be an exceptionally full-flavored stout with an incredible mouthfeel. I wouldn't reach for a bottle every weekend but, damn, I'd sure as hell like the chance to have it more often than once.

Pitch black with a puffy, cardboard-colored head. Thick and inviting when it's there, the head doesn't last long but it makes an impression.

The aroma - like a puppy made out of German chocolate cake and expresso, sitting in your lap and breathing in your face. Unavoidable, powerful, aromatic.

The description is no liar - ""tiramisu, sweet chocolate cake, and smooth vanilla."" I shit you not, brothers and sisters. But, as I stated before, it's an expert blend that pulls together the components to create a cohesive sweet, slightly bitter and coffee-forward taste that slides over the palate, pumps the brakes and takes it's sweet time pulling away. 

Thick, viscous, full-bodied. Huge mouthfeel; like a hippo in kiddie pool. 

Awesome beer. Wish I had more.","Dec 18, 2017"
Affogato,,Canada (QC),3.79/5,"Split 3-ways thanks Sam!
Pitch black with almost no head, a brown head dissipating very fast, even with a heavy pour head doesn't want to stay.
Smells a good amount of coffee, black chocolate, roasted malt, sweet vanilla.
Taste follows up the smell pretty much, smooth coffee, feels like drinking an espresso with a nice sweetness and hint of vanilla. Coffee with the ""Vanille française"" style.
What is the most disappointing part is the mouthfeel, it feels so watery, I don't really know why tho, I can't figure out how a 13.3% coffee, lactose and vanilla stout can be as light body as this, seriously it feels like I could just chug the whole bottle by my own.
I don't really know how to feel about it, did we had a problematic bottle? I don't really know it's the only one I've drank.","Dec 15, 2017"
Affogato,,Massachusetts,4.36/5,"Massive thanks to Kevin for sharing this beast.

A- Pitch black 750ml pour to a few becher around the Thanksgiving table. A thick and foamy deep tan cap up to a finger before it slowly falls to a medium belt at the edges. Small sheets of lace wrap down the glass.

S- A bold aroma of... Affogato. The rich dark and milk chocolate aromas follow up very strong espresso, vanilla, caramel sweets, roast barley, cocoa powder and chocolate milk. Really on point for affogato or ice cream sundae.

T- The espresso and roast grains pick up compared to the aroma and it really helps bring things together in harmony. Medium-dark roast coffee, milk chocolate, dark cocoa powder, chocolate milk, hot fudge sundae lead to vanilla beans, espresso, lactose sweets, caramel, general desserts and all things cocoa. A dessert beer for sure.

MF- Thick and massive body with a slick and syrupy texture. Medium-low level of carbonation and an oily feel. Ends a bit warm but this beer doesnt feel within miles of its ABV.

Affogato hot fudge sundae beer. Starts out amazing but the sweetness is eventually just a bit over the top to the point where a 1/3ish pour of the bottle was beyond enough.","Nov 27, 2017"

Mocha Wednesday,,New York,4.37/5,"2021 vintage. Pours a dark brown with lots of flecks of ruby red as the light hits it; pours rather thin with a fizzy cola head that disappears quickly. Bits of carb hitting the surface. No lacing/retention. Nose is roasted coffee beans, molasses, black licorice, loose change, baking chocolate. Very little barrel character, at least initially. Kind of mind-blowing these days to have a chocolate and coffee stout that doesn't lay it on thick with raw adjunct aromas; while the coffee and chocolate are certainly there, they feel like parts of a whole that developed together, rather than some gunk that's thrown in and overpowers the product. Taste follows a similar vein - big coffee roasted coffee bean notes throughout the palate. Through its very long finish, dark chocolate and dark fruit, vanilla, smoky wood, salty black licorice, and finally, traces of warming, spicy bourbon emerge. As on the smell, a really impressive use of the adjuncts here - not at all overpowering, but still present throughout. Mouthfeel is the only real knock for me. The feel is surprisingly thin, and I think a little more body would be nice (and even expected?) given the ABV. Really worth seeking out.","Apr 18, 2023"
Mocha Wednesday,,Pennsylvania,4.45/5,"2016 vintage. Poured from a brown wax topped bomber into a Tree House tulip. 19.4% ABV

L: Lighter than expected pour. Medium to dark mahogany color with ruby highlights. A thin fizzy off-white head falls fast. Not much in the way of lacing.

S: Rich and boozy. BOOZE. Bourbon and vanilla... some oak, cocoa, and coffee. Mostly booze.

T.F: Sweet and rich. Boozy... as expected at 19.4%. Deliciously complex. Cocoa and coffee mixed with oak, roast, and fudge. The coffee and chocolate especially come through and are nicely complemented by the bourbon and vanilla. A little thinner than expected. Medium bodied... boozy, but not as much as the 19.4% would make you think. Still very drinkable. Low carbonation. Coffee/cocoa finish.

O: An outstanding overdone ABV stout. Great barrel character... and you get a lot of bourbon, chocolate, and coffee on this brew. Held up super well at 6+ years in the cellar. This is an all-night sipper of a beer.","Jan 18, 2023"

Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some oak and fudge flavors noticeable too. Good amount of barrel character in both the taste and aroma.

Mocha Wednesday,,Missouri,4.32/5,"Pours a dark and muddy brown with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is okay. Aroma is mocha, toffee, caramel, coffee and soothing bourbon with a kiss of char. Roasty and toasty malts form a resoundingly steady base. Flavor profile is mocha, toffee, caramel and then a searing slice of bourbon and heat. After the heat subsides, the focus goes back to lightly sugary with a heavy malt base. Malts come by way of roasty and toasty. Sweetness comes from more mocha and chocolate than try to outweigh the lingering bourbon heat. Mouth feel is thick and full with a velvety, heavy creamery texture. Overall, hot and booze with some kisses and glimpses of sweet. Balance may be a strong word here, as it veers pretty far on both sides of the heat vs. sweet spectrum, but it does all net out within each dynamic sip.

Mocha Wednesday,,Alabama,4.35/5,"2015 Bottle. 18.6% ABV.

Dark pour, subtle crimson hue just like the others. Some thin, frothy head bubbles up on the pour, but it’s got a good look and the head dissipates quickly with no lace left behind. 

Loads of coffee on the nose with subtle but not unpleasant notes of green pepper. Many more experienced beer drinkers know green pepper to be an oxidation side effect in stouts that have coffee in them. Not abnormal, but not typically preferred. Those subtle hints of oxidation don’t take away from anything, though, with a predominance of espresso, baker’s chocolate, charred oak barrel, and bourbon aromas.

Rich notes of chocolate and coffee hit first, with less green pepper than on the nose. Overall, for a beer that is recommended to be consumed fresh has held up really well. Some charred oak character emerges as the beer warms and helps to compliment that bourbon flavor. Really nice balance between the base beer, the barrel, and the adjuncts. 

Nice medium weight to the beer, with low carbonation and a warm, boozy finish. Mildly viscous and not overly syrupy.","Dec 30, 2018"

The has carbonation bubbles pooling in the middle of the beer. Overall a good appearance. With high ABV I did not expect to see a lasting head or lacing.

A very decadent coffee and chocolate flavor with dark roasted malts, earthy, wood, earth, vanilla, raisins, bready and yeast flavors. 

The mouthfeel of the beer is hot and chewy.

This beer surprises me, the massive flavors with a delicate touch in a strong beer. The beer flavors are just off the charts.

This beer pours out just like the others, way lighter than beers similar in the style. Brown in color with highlights all the way through. The smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop. Raisins and plums evident as well. The taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes. A very nice chocolately finish. There is some coffee and mocha presence in there, but for the main part it's slight and if not advertised, I think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout.

Mocha Wednesday,,Minnesota,4.7/5,"Thanks to Chris the local guy for this 750ML bottle. Sampled this previously but never sat down with a full pour & very happy to do so. Split with my wife. 

The pour is surprisingly light, a muddly brown rather than abyssian darkness. Head vanishes quickly to nothing. The nose is just as advertised: chocolate, roast, booze, barrel. Meets expectations like rear-ended Ford Pinto. 

Mocha Wednesday is boozier than waking up inside a bourbon barrel; now I know how the dwarves felt on the Forest River (well, kind of). Massive hit of alcohol & bourbon in yo face, & my feet feel suddenly further away. Large scale sweetness from the malts, chocolate, roast that’s quieter than the nose would suggest. Underneath the chaos is molasses & something else I could identify if I wasn’t already drunk. Thick, decadent, & would pair well with my wife’s lovely Bailey’s cheesecake. Mmmmm. Love this. Could have taken it solo. 

Pastry stout has been used as a recent epitaph, but in my mouth it’s a viral compliment. Hand me a glass of this anytime. An elite beer that improves marginally on the near perfection that is Black Tuesday. Please help me up the stairs if you see me napping somewhere other than my bed later.

S: Rich coffee nose, boozy bourbon, and tons of cinnamon and spice fill the nose. Smells woody, roasted, earthy, spice, and sticky sweet.
T: Huge intense flavors of chocolatey cocoa nibs, rich and bold coffee, and sweet bourbon barrel mix with hints of cinnamon, caramel, vanilla, and a touch of roasted wood and licorice. The finish is full of peppery spice and roasted coffee, and the aftertaste has lingering notes of sticky sweet brown sugar and warming booze. 
M: Thick, sweet, sticky, and boozy body, fizzy/prickly carb, and a very sweet and heavy mouthfeel.
O: The coffee and chocolate add a nice depth to the bourbon barrel stout flavors. A couple years of age has rounded off the sharp edges, but this is still a very intense and decadent beer.","Mar 24, 2018"
Mocha Wednesday,,North Carolina,4.2/5,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/27/2017.

Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Mild increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but not overwhelming. Taste of huge nutty dark roasted coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, and dark bread; with lighter notes of coconut, marshmallow, molasses, licorice, smoke, dark fruit, pepper, and roast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate bourbon/oak spiciness and light roast/char bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, vanilla, cream, fudge, brown sugar, maple syrup, almond, bourbon, toasted oak, dark bread, coconut, marshmallow, light licorice/molasses/dark fruit, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Lightly increasing dryness from bourbon/oak spiciness and roast bitterness. Medium carbonation and very full body; with a smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Lightly increasing warmth of 19.9%, with mild lingering barrel booziness after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on slowly for the huge ABV. Bruery stouts always seem to have a class of their own on the flavor profile. Not as deeply roasty or charred on black/roasted malts like some others; but still extremely rich and complex. Outstanding barrel integration and balance; without feeling overly boozy, tannic, or drying. Very similar to the base beer with big levels of fruity/nutty coffee complexity. A highly enjoyable offering.","Feb 09, 2018"

Space Trace,,Massachusetts,4.07/5,"2018 bottle, drank March 2021 out of an oversized tulip.

Look - poured with little head, quite dark and sludgy.

Smell - faint, maybe a little roasty.

Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved. Nice taste, like it says on the bottle, like a chocolate cake, but I typically don’t like chocolate cake unless it’s tarted up with other stuff, and this was a straight chocolate cake taste. No alcohol or barrel to be found anywhere.

Feel - moderately thick.

Overall - a big let down for such an acclaimed beer. Firstly - I was most looking forward to that Bottle Logic Barrel and got none. Secondly, the chunk. Thirdly, the taste and smell didn’t jump out at me in any way. I mean, I didn’t NOT enjoy it, and it was cellared properly, but I’m just not feeling this one like other BLs.","Mar 21, 2021"

This has been a long time want for me and it was a big letdown. It was kind of a bitter mess. So dry, it was almost as if it were aged in cab franc barrels instead of bourbon. Barely any raw coconut with minimal sweetness. I seem to be the odd one out here. Maybe it was a bad bottle because I know the height of quality these guys usually reach with their barrel aged beers.","Sep 06, 2018"
Space Trace,,Florida,4.78/5,"This beer is throwing me for a loop. Second time I am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like FO than a chocolate coconut beer. Pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style. Leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer. You get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose. A little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character. Coconut doesn’t really stand out however. The taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms. A touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so. Another hit from bottle logic. Nice barrel, sweet, balanced and utterly delicious.","Aug 30, 2018"
Space Trace,,Illinois,4.47/5,"2018 Bottle. Typical deep dark brown-black appearance with minimal foam around only edge of glass.

Bourbon and booziness are well integrated also. Really good mouthfeel. Leaves the lips sticky after a few sips. 

A lot of coconut beers make you feel like you're tasting Banana Boat suntan lotion (like Last Buffalo in the Park). This beer however doesn't do that. Coconut is there but because of it's well integrated with chocolate and bourbon sweet flavors, it's is just right.","Aug 19, 2018"

I don't know how they made this happen - something about New Glarus Strawberry Rhubarb bottles - but, I love Bottle Logic, and I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to try Space Trace.

I was really startled by how barrel-forward Space Trace is. I'm a bit accustomed at this point to how vanilla forward many of their beers tend to be - but Space Trace smacks you in the face right away with a strong barrel nose and taste. It's follow by lots of chocolate and coconut, with very pleasant bourbon notes. It's a thick, rich beer, which is a very nice change from thin coconut beers (typically rum barrel-aged).

While I really love Space Trace, it's one that doesn't drink itself - it's delicious, but it's an active drinker - it requires attention and appreciation. I could only drink just a bit of it - certainly not a whole bottle - at a sitting. Then again, it's summer - so it may just be a seasonal thing!

2019 vintage from pint growler filled at B&V. Poured into tulip glass. 

Same as prior but this time appearance was much better. Huge tan head, tons of thick lacing. Same great smell, taste and feel. About as close to perfect as I can imagine. 

Feb 2020 Review
2017 vintage from pint growler bottles at Barrels & Vines 18 months or so ago. Poured into a pint tulip glass. 

Basically the same review as in the past. This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste. ABV is well hidden; this one can get you into trouble. Super creamy moist. Still pretty much my favorite beer ever except for the high ABV and, now, taproom only distribution.

June 2018 Update
Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines. 

Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait! 
Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover.

2017 vintage (orange ball).
Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation. 

Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless. 

Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms. 

Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right. Like the taste, it gets better as it warms. 

Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.

Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another!","Feb 22, 2020"
No Rules,,New York,4.42/5,"2016 vintage with the Purple Bowling Ball on the label, it pours pitch black color with a small tan/mocha colored head that faded faster then normal and left minimal traces of lacing. Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale.

Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers.","Jan 11, 2020"

No Rules,,Massachusetts,4.49/5,"A- Pours truly like motor oil with a body as dark as darkness itself and a small brown cap. The frothy foam slowly falls and lacing is sparse with some webs and sheets.

S- The dark roasty grains really shine here with deep cocoa powder, pure roast barley, espresso and char notes. With warmth the barrel and coconut open up quite a bit but in the end the aroma is rather balanced. Toasty coconut, oaky vanilla, smooth bourbon, milk chocolate, slight dried dark fruits, sugar and toffee.

T- This is a big boy. Honestly doesn't drink even close to 15% with the coconut and roasted grains coming out as the main flavors in the brew. Luscious toasted coconut and medium dark chocolate leads into vanilla oak bourbon, dark roast coffee, charred grain, toffee, slight dark dry fruits, toasted nuts, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla bean, fresh toasted woody oak and peppery whiskey.

MF- Massive thickness to this dark oily monster. Slick and sweet syrup with a rich and frothy consistency. Ends warm but this is smooth.

No Rules,,Florida,4.24/5,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass. Purple bowling ball (2016 bottle).

A: Very dark brown, nicely opaque, with a thin tan head that fades to a ring along the sides. Low visible carbonation.

S: Big bourbon up front, with less, but still big, oakiness. As the bourbon punch fades the coconut, vanilla, and chocolate malts show up. Roasted malts, cacao, mild char, and dark roasted coffee. Light tobacco as well. Definitely booze-forward, but yet still not a particularly ""alcoholic"" smell. Really nice here.

T: Chocolate and bourbon, vanilla and coconut. Oak tannins and sweetness, with milk chocolate and roasted malts. Some ethanol burn, drying tobacco, and notes of caramel and milder sorghum. Then more coconut. A mild roast bitterness and milder hop bitterness near the end, but ultimately fails to even come close to balancing the sweetness – chocolate with coconut plus the vanilla swells at the end, but some bourbon sweetness ultimately wins out after the swallow.

O: A nice thick body for a porter, although this seems like a “porter” in name only. The alcohol is quite prevalent, albeit very well-hidden for anything claiming to be 15%. Low carbonation sensation, but seems fitting for this beer.

O: This is quite good. A nice coconut and chocolate and bourbon balance. But it's pretty sweet – and that comes from a guy in Florida used to CCB, Angry Chair, and Cycle stouts. I wish there was just a little more bitterness here – whether from the roast or hops I wouldn’t care. It’s not quite disagreeably cloying, but even splitting the bottle two ways the sweetness is just a little more than I was looking for.","Nov 02, 2018"

Peche Du Fermier,,Missouri,4.55/5,"Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

Deep yellow-orange (like a peach) color appearance with foam which quickly dissipates. This smells like peach already, but a lot of barnyard funk too in the aroma.

Tart and dry finish.","Dec 24, 2020"
Peche Du Fermier,,Ohio,4.3/5,"Foggy dull burnt orange with a short but persistent white blanket leaving some solid sheeting with a tilt.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk.

This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger.","Jul 06, 2020"
Peche Du Fermier,,Tennessee,4.49/5,Blend #2,"Nov 15, 2019"
Peche Du Fermier,,Germany,3.92/5,"Pours a clouded orange color with a medium, froth head.

Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist.

Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation.

Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste.

Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs.","Oct 27, 2019"
Peche Du Fermier,,Minnesota,4.55/5,"Peach is probably my favorite fruit adjunct - and Saison du Fermier is a fantastic beer for fruit.

The nose is fantastic - tons of fresh, juicy, citrusy fruit. The taste is explosive - tons of funk, fleshy peach, and just a bit of wine barrel. It's lightly dry, but still dishes plenty of that juicy fruit.

Fantastic. I think Abricot du Fermier may edge it just slightly, but Peche is wonderful!","Jun 04, 2019"
Peche Du Fermier,,Virginia,4.21/5,"Blend #2. 

A: Pours an effervescent, orangish gold with a cap of fizzy, white head that dissipates almost immediately. 

S: Bright peaches, moderate Bretty/earthy funk, light white pepper, and a background note of oak and barrel spice.

T: Bracing sourness, medium-light peaches, roundish white wine, a bit of pepper, and moderate sourness through a long finish. The sourness is quite high, almost mouth puckeringly so. 

M: Light bodied, crisp, with medium-high carbonation. Nice refreshing aspect.

O: The peaches are a nice addition but the base beer seems more sour, and less elegant, than I remember Saison du Fermier being. As is typical of the fruit, the peaches are fairly faint, too.","Mar 16, 2019"

Peche Du Fermier,,Colorado,4.31/5,"a little less intense on the fruit than some of the other stone fruit wild beers i have had from these guys, and exceedingly acidic, but like is almost always the case with these guys, its really hard to be very critical when the beer is this refined and high quality, even if its not quite what i personally prefer in the style, especially next the the raspberry version of this, where i think the high and bright acidity worked a little bitter, where it brought up the raspberry and extended it, i think it runs over the peaches a little bit, but this also seems drier, so maybe some more of the peach has been fermented out than was the case with the raspberries, kind of like comparing apples to oranges really, or raspberries to peaches, haha. still fuzzy and soft and winey and woody and tannic and sexy, its just that the pervasive sourness seems way ahead of the funk i like, and the nuance just isnt as high, not necessarily a critique, just an observation. carbonation is awesome though, and it does finish fast and yummy. a little rough on the belly after a minute, but the peaches worked into the winey base is nice, the oak does mellow it all some, and the naturalness and high quality are evident. fun series, but this one and the apricot were not the standouts, at least for me. still leagues better than what just about everyone else is doing in this style...","Nov 02, 2018"

Peche Du Fermier,,Texas,4.5/5,"light dry lemony peach flavor, effervescent","Mar 04, 2016"
Peche Du Fermier,,Indiana,4.78/5,"A- Pours a bright orange-golden in color with plenty of sediment and floaters in the first pours. The color is brilliant, just like you sliced open a fresh peach. A small to medium, fizzy head forms and hangs around for a little while, leaving just a touch of lacing. Some yeast and fruit pieces are constantly moving in the pour due to high carbonation levels.

S- Dry and slightly tart notes hit the nose first and fairly strongly. Oak dry characteristics are in there as well underneath the initial dry saison tartness. In the middle to back half of the smell the peaches come out to play with a juicy and fruity, fresh peach scent. The smell that lingers in the nose is a combination of fruit and dryness.

T- When this brew hits the lips, the taste profile follows sort of an inverted arc from the scent. The peaches kick off the flavors with a lightly tart, juicy, and then lightly sweet flavor. It is just a touch more sour than biting into a fresh peach. Following the peaches, there is a small ramp up in the tartness that is just a bit on the acidic side. In the middle of the drink, the peaches return and the base beer tartness subsides a bit, blending the drink into a mellow blend of saison and peaches. At the back end of the drink the oak displays itself with the flavor drying out a bit. The lingering flavor on the tongue is light oak dryness and delicious peaches.

M- This beer hits a unique sweetspot as far as feel goes, being moderately carbonated, yet insanely smooth. Most beers of the same style would be highly carbonated, light, and drink basically like a champagne, but this drinks almost like a fruit juice. The body of the beer is somewhere right in the middle of the spectrum, not being too thick or too thin. There is no trace of the 8% ABV and the drink is quite refreshing overall.

Overall, I know that I liked the Abricot a lot, but the Peche definitely holds up as a phenomenal beer as well. The presence of the fruit with the tartness, without letting the tartness take over the peaches, is really a testament to the nuance that Cory is able to brew. I'm glad I finally got around to opening this one. I love when Cory decides to marry fruit to his saisons, and tasting this one gets me amped up to crack open an Abricot blend 2!","Oct 04, 2015"

To be honest, I'm not getting much on the nose. It's a fairly faint citrus hop aroma. 
Taste - There's a citrus flavor to this beer due to the hops, and I think it's tangerine that I'm getting from the hops. The flavor from the hops really keeps building in my throat, and on my taste buds. The flavor lingers in my throat, and I just keep tasting it. 
The body is juicy and also has a crisp feeling. The hops linger in my throat, but they don't feel sticky, or like resin.

Bold orange peel upfront develops into a palate layered with waves of tropical melon, ripe papaya, lychee and lime. With a gentle touch of pine and a pleasant biscuity sweetness, displays a full body and smooth pillowy mouthfeel that makes each returning sip enjoyable.

Insert Hip Hop Reference There,,Massachusetts,3.93/5,"Thanks for the can Kevin!

A- Tallboy into a tulip with an incredibly muddy and murky, hazy golden body more like a milkshake than a beer, at least in the past. A one finger cap forms with a foamy texture up to about half a cm high. Fair head retention and lacing is just found in a few spots after the head dies out completely. 

S- An absolutely massive hop aroma with citrus up front and tropical fruits beyond that with floral and pine notes hanging in the backdrop. When it comes down to it this aroma is basically orange juice with hints of grapefruit, dank herbs, huge pineapple, tangerine, melon, creamsicle, bubble gum and mango. Bright and fresh hop bomb.

T- The orange and pineapple juice theme continues onto the palate and a moderate sweetness and booziness joins in with the massive hops and bitterness. A whole lot of bold flavors on the taste buds. Orange and pineapple juice blend leads into big ruby red grapefruit juice, bitter pine resin, melon, clementine peel, mango and lime. The booze is real here and while it doesn't disturb the hops that much certain sips end warm and are reminiscent of a tropical mixed drink. Hints of whole grain bread, cereal, cracker and alcohol.

MF- Heavy and slick body that is very substantial on the palate. The texture seems to come out late but the dextrins from the mash provide a silky feel and a luscious milky creaminess. Ends very warm.

A good Trillium offering but the high end ABV is just intense at times and accentuates the heavy citrus bitterness making it taste like a piece of citrus zest on the edge of a tropical mixed drink.","Oct 17, 2018"

Pours a bright pulpy yellow body, slight settling orange hue; one finger thick white head, good retention and rings of lacing despite the high ABV. As soon as I pull the tab back, it seems like the aroma was being barely held in by the aluminum, and bursts out in wafts of massive grapefruit, citrus and miscellaneous tropical fruits. Maaaasive fruit bomb that ultimately settles a little bit when the caramel and dextrin malt kicks in a fair dose of sweetness. This is probably the best, if not one of the best, hop aromas I've had the fortune to smell. Flavour is more of a balance of a big sugary dextrin, and relatively light (though not insubstantial) caramel sweetness added to the big tropical fruit and citrus bite. Excellent. Even adds a warming feeling to the back of my throat and stomach from the relatively high ABV. Mouthfeel is medium bodied although it remains not too thin or watery, with a big balance of sugary and hoppy depth backing things up on the backend, mild-moderately bitter with a decent warming heat on the backend.

Served in a tulip

Fairly unattractive appearance. The body was somewhere between cloudy and opaque but poured thinner than I anticipated. A small cap of cream colored bubbles topped the liquid and quickly fizzled away. No lacing or head retention whatsoever.

The nose was punchy and bright. Juicy, fruity hop notes dominated. Big tropical fruit presence. Overripe mango and papaya came to mind. Hint of booziness. Citrus notes were apparent too. Freshly squeezed orange juice specifically. Some tangerine as well.

The flavor profile was fairly sweet and boozy. Juicy orange notes came through strong. Lots of tangerine and clementine too. Fair amount of sugary sweetness. Pineapple and peach notes appeared in the center. Pithy white grapefruit notes came through on the back end. The beer finished with an intense combination of bitter citrus rind, resiny pine sap, sugary malt sweetness and boozy heat. I could also feel a hoppy burn in my throat after the swallow.

The mouthfeel was thinner bodied for a triple IPA and contained a fine, rather subtle carbonation. As the beer moved along the palate, the liquid turned creamier and fluffed up a bit. The 10% unfortunately came across as surprisingly hot.

I usually appreciate the hoppy/sweet/boozy combo found in most triple IPAs, but Insert Hip Hop Reference There was a bit overwhelming. Perhaps more time on this might help integrate the flavors and smooth out some of its rougher edges.","Sep 08, 2018"

Reaction State tiptoes along the abyss of cinnamon gorge. Cinnamon is straddling the beer but doesn’t quite crush it into submission. Underneath the spice are touches of maple, vanilla, & the ghost of cocoas past. Light bourbon winds its way betwixt & between & the finish is mulled apple cider. Should have split this one with my wife. 

Hey brewers: quit putting so much fucking cinnamon in your beers. If you can’t get the balance right, throw the crap away. Pretty good beer, which is sad, as I can sense something really good underneath the cinnamon avalanche.","Jan 01, 2023"
Reaction State,,New Jersey,4.57/5,"Pours a dark brown like motor oil. Just a half of a finger of dark brown head shows up and disappears just as quickly. 

Nose is a walloping of bourbon barrel aged stout. Its got that rich, dense, still wet barrel level of intensity. Huge oak profile. I love it. Next is the roasted malt and a strong presence of chocolate. This reminds me a little of one of my favorites of all time; Weyerbacher's Chocolate Pretzel Sunday Morning Stout. Then in the background, there lies the cinnamon. 

Taste is much of the same on the nose. Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, cinnamon. But now I get the slight bit of maple syrup. Maple syrup presents almost with, I hesitate to say this, but a sour note when its put in stouts sometimes. Like an extremely subtle tartness or tanginess. It doesn't detract, but it is a unique quality. The tannins from the barrel kind of leave that soapy flavor that also sometimes tends to happen in these barrel aged stouts. Its incredibly mild and doesn't linger, but thats why I decided to put it at a 4.5 rather than 4.75, similar to the nose.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Brief flash of carbonation right at the beginning. ABV makes its presence known, but not as severely as that Maumasi I had the other night. There is a little bit of drying but not harsh on the palate or on the way down. 

Overall my favorite Bottle Logic brew so far. I was surprised because I though this was just going to be another ""breakfast stout"", but this one actually blew me away. Well balanced and all the flavors work well with each other and don't feel like novelty additions. Masterclass level stuff.","Dec 11, 2022"

Taste - In the profile, coffee led the way. Cinnamon came in second place, and it was not overdone but gave a nice element of spice. I struggle to find a vanilla notes and the barrel profile was mild. The coffee and cinnamon carried to the finish.

T: Whiskey, dark cocoa, hint of dark roastiness, a bit of ethanol and vanilla. Dark roast coffee on a long finish. Maple is hard to detect. Moderate sweetness complements the flavors nicely without crossing the line into too sweet. 

M: Full bodies, medium carbonation. Slight, smooth alcohol warmth.

Stout aged in maple syrup bourbon barrels then finished with cacao nibs, cinnamon and barrel aged coffee

APPEARANCE: Murky black pour yields a three finger, medium looking, super fizzy and crackly tan head that quickly fizzes like coke down to a half wisp and ring. Opaque black body with some carbonation streaming up the middle. A ring and dots of wisp remain leaving no real lacing down the glass. 

SMELL: Big nose of bourbon, maple syrup, cinnamon and roasted coffee for sure. Sweet cream, dark chocolate, cookie dough and vanilla on the nose as well. Bold and very decadent. Lovely. 

TASTE: Maple syrup, coffee for sure, cinnamon and bourbon barrels with notes of sweet cream up front. Flavorful and full of character with some minty alcohol and vanilla at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish is decadent, including oak, bourbon and maple syrup, roasted coffee, sweet cream, dark chocolate and vanilla, cookie dough and some cinnamon spice as well, though that is rather restrained. 

PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Enough weight for sure, creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes somewhat sticky. A touch of heat lingers. 

OVERALL: Awesome. This is delicious and is another great example of how well Bottle Logic does stout beer. Too bad this wasn’t a 750. The barrel aged component compliments the base stout excellently and the adjuncts are done really, really well. This one was well worth the wait and is something I’d recommend to anyone who’s a fan of this type of stuff. Thanks again for this one, vanlingleipa. Outstanding.","Jun 23, 2017"

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),,Massachusetts,4.24/5,"2020 vintage. A very solid and canonical example of the style, perhaps *the* prototype of what a bourbon barrel aged RIS should emulate.

Consumed 10/28/2022

I just got a job offer today, so I needed to pull something out of my cellar to celebrate. I traded a bottle of EH Taylor small batch for this bottle of beer, so let's see if it lives up the hype and $50 I paid for the bourbon. It does look spot on amazing. It's super thick but not syrupy in a bad way. This is the kind of stout that beginners would hate and neck bearded beer nerds crave. On the tongue it's super full and soft. Absolutely perfect for the style for me. I'm not getting enough on the nose though to wow me. I get bourbon and chocolate. I smell the typical lovely bitterness of a RIS. Still, it's lacking in the nose for me. Drinking it though everything lives up to the hype. It's less sweet than a typical Goose BCS which set the standard for me back in the day. I can taste the booziness but in a good way. I like high abv stouts where I can taste the alcohol a bit. Why make a bourbon barrel aged stout if the bourbon isn't front and center? What's different and great is that there's also the balance of the base beer. There's a lot of plain old RIS here. Take your best like a Darkness or Expedition and add the bourbon with everything balancing out perfectly. The finish is long and toasty like a good cup of coffee. A great beer and worth the bourbon (at retail.)","Oct 28, 2022"

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),,Connecticut,4.26/5,"Bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022

Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.

Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.

An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.","Jan 30, 2022"

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),,Illinois,4.49/5,"500ml black waxed bottle poured into HF white etched logo Charente glass (aka wine stem ""bulb"" glass).

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead.

bottled on date is Jan 10, 2020.

Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass.

Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke. 

Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time. 

Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture.","Nov 02, 2021"

Jet black with a dark brown head with good retention and lacing. The nose has a lot of dark chocolate, licorice, a little anise, soy, vanilla, a little booze and plums, a little tobacco. Rich and deep. 

The palate opens moderately sweet, with plums, dark caramel, dark chocolate and some bourbon. Dark honey, buckwheat honey and licorice follow, with an anise spiciness complementing the bourbon notes. While sweet, this isn't cloying, favoring balance and structure instead ( but what did you expect?). Fruit cake, dessert like and rich, but still approachable and also uncompromising. Flavors of molasses, particularly the bitterness one finds in treacle, temper the sweetness. Full in body, softly, creamily carbonated, this is spectacular on the palate. Luscious, full,creamy and luxuriating. Sweet on the finish with lingering plum and tobacco to go with the leathery booze note, this is quite stellar. This beer is an older school stout barrel aged in an old school way. The flavors lean heavily on the malt, especially the licorice and tobacco notes, and the barrel provides a little heat but also oxidative softness to the flavor profile. Impressive.

Aroma is pretty mellow, there is some molasses, bourbon, fudge, tobacco, and oak qualities. 
On palate is a beautiful blend of decadent barrel sweetness that really develops as it warms – there is caramel and vanilla truffles, rich fudge, some roasty character invoking roasted nuts, plenty of oaky wood quality, burnt brown sugar, molasses, marshmallow covered in melted bourbon chocolates, toffee, warm spice quality. Dark fruit flavor becoming more noticeable as it warms and opens up, definitely some raisin in there and a licorice flavor dancing around. Lots of complexity led by some truly decadent flavors, a perfect brew to enjoy on a holiday evening. I am sipping on this one with family over the course of a few hours, must say that the flavors are always delicious but become absolutely stunning about an hour in. 
Despite the bold flavors mentioned above, the end result is smooth and almost restrained, everything is so balanced and harmonious. The mouthfeel is medium plus and has a velvety texture, very complimentary and accentuates the flavor profile without being sludgy or cloyingly thick.","Dec 23, 2019"

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),,New York,4.74/5,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This is just about as good as it gets for non-""adjuncted"" barrel-aged stouts. There's a ton going on here - it's primarily deep and fudgy. There's also caramel and maple sweetness, a bit of smoky bitterness, heavy roast, barrel vanilla, oak, toffee-heavy bourbon, and a little bit of coffee. This is hard to beat.

This is silky, but not super thick, with a very high level of drinkability. It just feels good in your mouth, you know...nothing weird?

Like many of Hill's non-adjunct barrel aged stouts, this is absurdly woody with a smoky hickory character.

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),,Vermont,4.45/5,"Bottled 3-28-18

L-The beer pours glossy and black allowing no light penetration even at the edges. The head is a modest 3/4 finger high and mocha in color. The head recedes to a thin film with thicker central island. Lacing is minimal but can be raised by swirling.
S-The nose is dark chocolate with bourbon riding over the top of it.
T-The nose translates to palate exactly. There is a fantastic dark chocolate base which transitions mid palate to a pleasant medium strength bourbon presence. The two elements mix in the finish with the chocolate from the malts lasting slightly longer into the aftertaste.
F- Mouthfeel overall is on the higher side of medium. Carbonation is light. This is one of the thicker barrel aged stouts that I've had. It has a slick, silky feel on the tongue which coats and allows the flavors to linger.

Starry Noche is thick, but you knew that. It’s full of raw coconut flavor, but it says that right on the bottle. Big, sweet malts, but hey, imperial stout, am I right? And barrels, which is in smaller type amid a 121 word description of the beer: the bourbon is swinging low, the rye is bringing a small dose of spiciness. Nary a trace of booziness, which is impressive, & means that one/me could drink a full 500ML without blinking. I am still blinking. Like a leaf tailed gecko. 

One of the better of the pantheon. Nothing subtle about this big, bad stout. Excellent brew.","Apr 12, 2023"
Starry Noche,,New Mexico,3.94/5,"Too thicc. Too sweet for more than 4 ounces. Tastes like your drinking cake batter, like literally drinking sugar sludge, it’s really cool at first and then you crave beer because you realize it’s just gelatin and you’re chewing","Jan 21, 2023"
Starry Noche,,Colorado,4.68/5,"A bottle pick up from the brewery October 2022. 

Pours a used motor oil black and thick leaving no foam to speak of. Coconut floaties dot the surface and oily residue coats the glass. The smell is bourbon, coconut and some hazelnut. A taste that matches the smell with moderately sweet hazelnut, coconut and bourbon. There's a hint of oak that shows in the finish. The feel is super thick, oily and warming. 

In all this is damn near perfect as dessert stouts go. Ignore the floaties and the price, dive in and enjoy the decadence. You only live once!","Jan 02, 2023"

Starry Noche,,Colorado,4.45/5,"you have to like them thick, because this is about as dense as beer gets, on the edge of not even being liquid, but it was awesome to get to drink on this, crazy to me how weldwerks is now maker of rare high value trade beer, the hype has really run wild for stuff like this. impossibly dense, high shine and the darkest of browns, black in lower light, no real head at all, but still crazy to look at, almost jelly, long legs, and such a unique aroma, this definitely is very original beer, not like a million others despite what it seems like, and a few things jump out. the first is the quality of the bourbon, not sure what barrels they use for this, but its a league better than most, vanilla and brown sugar and toffee and toasted wood, there is richness and decadence here, impressive, mature, sexy. the other thing is all the coconut, there is loads off it in here, way ahead of any hazelnut for me, earthy and tropical at the same time, real authentic. lastly, i love all the roast, sure there is a lot of sugar in this still, but its so well balanced because there is a huge low end on it, almost burnt coffee, light smoke but smooth not acrid, and beautiful specialty dark malts, this is super well built. the flavor is good espresso, whiskey, and oak, some vanilla and brownie batter too, but its stout first before its flavored stout which is cool, the coconut comes on about half way through, toasted more than raw, and the hazelnut is all at the end. i taste it forever, its completely palate coating, and the alcohol doesnt thin it out at all. not quite a fire breather, but its real strong. it stays with me awhile, but i love the way it finishes, still some bitterness, a creme brulee top thing, the bourbon, rich wet oak, caramel, and about as much body as you can have in a beer. the subtle nutty finish is awesome, and overall its hard not to be impressed, even if a little of this is plenty for me. worth the hype, cool to get to try this, monster beer but not just big for the sake of it, intentional every step of the way, very good!","Oct 15, 2022"

Starry Noche,,North Carolina,4.3/5,"To be clear this is absolutely a desert beer. Recommended to be had in s 4-6oz glass. Extremely thick dark color resembling black syrup. No head or carbonation. There’s a large amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut aromas. Looks, smells and tastes of hazelnut syrup. A little bit goes a long way. Arguably limited to no bourbon taste all hazelnut and chocolate syrup. Very unique goes well at the end of a meal with desert. 

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

I really like big pastry stouts, but this one is just too much. I used to really like the Medianoche series, but they seem to just be dialing it up way too far lately.","Aug 28, 2022"
Starry Noche,,New York,3.63/5,"This one pours an exceptionally thick looking dark black color, with a small head, and a bit of sticky dark lacing.

This smells like incredibly sweet melted milkshakes – it smells good, but it’s just ridiculously over the top.

There’s an absurd amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut on the nose here – like a high quality hazelnut coffee thing. Like, it’s certainly tasty, objectively, but it’s just so over the top. More than 1 oz of this is more than enough. There’s basically no barrel, it’s just hazelnut, vanilla, and chocolate syrup overload.

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

Starry Noche,,Norway,4.97/5,"For starters: absolutely loved batch 2 (from last year as well. BUT, that is not why I’m here reviewing this magical moment…

My wife got me this one as a X-mas gift some time back, and I’ve been saving it for an occation… with yesterday being that day. The bold 600 ml bottle of B1 is looking really bubbly/curly when pouring in glass- but also: The nose is completely out-of-this-world, bursting with chocolate, hazelnuts and the thickest body imaginable. Mouthfeel is simply outstandingly incredible! This is quite possibly the best beer I’ve had- at least among the top 3. Long lasting, delicious taste that lingers. So happy I got to experience this one!","Mar 23, 2022"
Starry Noche,,Ohio,2.52/5,"Headlessly viscous burnt black with brown edges, the ominous appearance can't even begin to hint at just how HOLY SHIT WEIRD this 2021 bottle truly is.

Hazelnut paste quickly morphs into cashew cheese and buttered popcorn pot de creme that even verges into popcorn Jelly Belly, as one friend put it. But then my old lady described its nose as dirty dish rag and now I can't smell anything but.

We all had different glasses from different houses and this was our first pour during this bottle share, yet we all had the same offensive experience.

The mouthfeel is otherwise that thick and luscious, almost carbless globularity often hyptastically sought after these days, but not typically my own cup of tea. It clung ever so desperately to the kitchen sink as we drained pour the remaining putrescence.

How b2 has an over 4.5 rating on UnTappd is beyond me. What a bunch of sick, palate-wrecked liars. Speaking of, Anchorage's Sent By Liars is a far superior pastry stout if you're looking for something slightly more accessible that features these adjuncts.","Mar 21, 2022"
Starry Noche,,California,4.46/5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours THICK like motor oil. Wow. Black with almost black head. The nose is incredible. Mostly hazelnuts upfront. Liquid hazelnut cream. Nutella all the way. It's almost hard to pick up much else. Over some time just sitting with the nose, I start to get some dark toffee, coconut, and more milk chocolate. Not a lot of barrel there. 

The taste is insane. More dimensions than the nose. Definitely still getting the hazelnut as the dominant flavor, but also picking up some bourbon, toffee, chocolate, molasses, sweet dark fruit. I might say it's a bit too sweet, which is where I dock it a few points. Otherwise, the taste is really nice.

The mouthfeel is ridiculous. So thick and creamy. I would say this is the thickest and creamiest stout I have ever tasted. Definitely a treat.","Mar 04, 2022"

Starry Noche,,Alabama,4.54/5,"2021 release. Opened 02/12/2022.

Hazelnut bomb, but in all the best ways. It’s a bit oily and finishes bitter, but when paired with the coconut and thick stout base, it all combines for an amazing experience. And for the price point? 100% worth it every time.

2022 release. Opened 11/13/2022.

Familiar WW motor oil viscosity; thick, oily, zero carb on the pour. Thin line of brown head settles. 

Mounds bar on the nose; great balance of dark chocolate & coconut candy. On the back end you get some nutella, but surprised at how restrained the hazelnut is overall.

On the palate this is distinctly less pastry than the previous batch of Starry, but in a great way. You get a slightly slick, mildly bitter coconut component that trails off to introduce notes of dark fruit, restrained nuttiness, and even a bit of tobacco on the tail to round out a very unexpected complexity to the overall profile.

With them, progressively more richness / pastry sweetness on the nose.

Viscosity is familiarly heavy and thick, sweet but not cloying, and with a nice ethanol heat on the way down. A touch of residual bitterness accompanies a full mouth-coating.","Feb 13, 2022"
Starry Noche,,Florida,4.15/5,"500 mL bottle. Inky black. Smells of coconut and hazelnut. A little bourbon behind. Tastes of bourbon, lots of hazelnut, coconut, sweet chocolate, roasted malt.

Starry Noche,,Illinois,4.74/5,"A shameless explosion of blended barrels and adjuncts that stole my heart, incredible. Black oil appearance with a short lived brown cap. Smell bursts forth with hazelnut, coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate, backed with complex barrel flavors. For the taste I must once again admit I am a hazelnut fan, so this was paradise for me, huge rich hazelnut and chocolate dance amongst the oak and bourbon soak coconut, vanilla, faint dark roast coffee, caramel, and nutella. Feel is thick, chewy, warm, has a hint of nuttiness but way more so rich, full and decadent with the weight.

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Illinois,4.45/5,"500 ml bottle into a snifter. Bottled 7/20/21, had 3/12/22.

Pours an opaque dark brown, with a quarter inch quickly dissipating head and some spotty cling. Aromas of bourbon, oak, char, malt, chocolate, some vanilla, a little leather. Has a spicy, peppery aroma. Flavors of bourbon, oak, malt, vanilla, chocolate, raisins, char, a little licorice on the finish and in the aftertaste. Has a spicy taste, somewhat black pepper like. Smooth, a very good full body, appropriately carbonated.

Really enjoyable. Lots of barrel and oak, many distinct and expressive aromas and flavors. Not quite as full bodied for a BCS effort, but it’s not a negative.","Jun 04, 2023"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Indiana,4.75/5,"This beer pours a perfect onyx black with zero leakage on the edges and sports a dark tan head that is a bit creamy and sticks around for a surprising amount of time given the 16% ABV. A gorgeous representation of an imperial stout.

The nose is boozy up front, again no surprise with the high ABV, but there’s also huge milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and stone fruit (as ripe dark cherries ) notes that literally have me drooling. There’s a LOT packed into this big beer.

The taste has a nice boozy note up front that is not distracting at all, and flows into the milk chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, and dark cherry flavors, with a nice warming alcohol note at the back of the palate. This is perfectly balanced and world class at the highest level, IMHO.

The mouthfeel is full, substantial, and coats the palate. This is everything a BA imperial stout should be, again IMHO.","Apr 02, 2023"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Pennsylvania,4.39/5,"Opened my bottle of this with a friend of mine who had the Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel bourbon so we could try them side by side. The beer pours much like any BCBS, rich dark black color with a thin brown head on top. The smell has a pretty healthy barrel presence to it, some roast and chocolate in there too. Taste is solid, nice chocolate mixed with bourbon and wood notes. The feel was personally my favorite part of the beer, it was smooth, hardly any boozy heat, the fact that it was 16% and drank so easily is very impressive.

Pours black with a small ring of head, looks still. Smell is boozy, toasted coconut, coffee and anise, burnt vanilla sweetness.

Taste is gorgeous, wow. Blast of chocolate syrup and vanilla, coffee roast in the background, booziness isn't gone but it's muted. Toasted coconut is also there, and also (thankfully) muted. Lots going on, and it meshes together well.

Mouthfeel is thick, not sticky enough for me to call it syrupy, slight grittiness. Overall, really excellent beer.","Feb 12, 2023"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,New York,4.71/5,"Appearance: Goose Island Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout has a deep, opaque black color with a thick and creamy tan head that dissipates slowly.

Taste: On the palate, the flavor is full and intense, with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The taste is a balance of sweet and bitter, with a mix of dark chocolate, caramel, toasted bread, and vanilla. The whiskey barrel aging is also present, giving it a slightly warming, bourbon finish.

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,California,4.49/5,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours motor oil black with a very thin layer of brown head. The nose is full of roasted malts, black licorice, burnt toffee, alcohol heat, tar, oak, molasses, very dark chocolate, and a hint of cherries. Really nice and intense on the nose. 

The taste is pretty amazing. VERY different from the regular BCBS, which is always a worry with some of the special stouts. This one is full of dark roasted malts, chocolate, huge boozy bourbon flavors, burnt toffee, raisins, prunes, molasses, sesame seeds, oak, and some black licorice (although less than predicted based on the nose). Very intense all around. 

The mouthfeel is pretty thick and viscous, with a significant alcohol burn on the way down. I wonder what another year would do for this beer. The aftertaste is primarily burnt toffee and bourbon. Overall, a fantastic special release.","Dec 22, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Michigan,3/5,"BCBS Toasted from last year. I do enjoy Elijah Craig Toasted so I thought I would enjoy this more than I did especially because it’s already been in bed for a year. Lots of vanilla, black cherry, raisin, and burnt oak. The complaint isn’t that the flavors aren’t there. But, this is hot. Ive drank beers in the last couple months that were in the same ABV ballpark, maybe even a smidge higher and this one is just a little much. I like bourbon and I like bourbon flavors very much but I typically enjoy my BBA beers devoid of ethanol burn. 3/5 average on this one just because it’s got the flavor.","Dec 03, 2022"

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Connecticut,4.1/5,"2021 vintage (best before 7/20/2026); consumed on 11/28/2022

Pours an inky, void-black capped with two fingers of soapy, dark khaki-hued foam; solid head retention yields a half-finger of cap, large and lasting, frothy collar, and limited array of webby, splotchy lacing clinging temporarily to the walls of the glass.

Aromas waft dry rickhouse with an air of soft cherry into subtle roast gleaning fresh bakers cocoa; dusty oak and straight butterscotch-laden bourbon gloss through the middle to a richer milk chocolate culmination building steadily.

Taste brings subtle cherry and dusty cocoa upfront, with a biting oak over the mid-palate yielding oak shavings and bourbon residuals as toffee, leather, and tobacco edges mark the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body and a subtle carbonation, leaving creamy textures atop a slick undercurrent through the mid-palate, with a boozy prickle into an intense warming on the finish.

Ardent bourbon inflects drying rickhouse potency, quelling a massive ABV to meet the comparatively understated malted chocolate layering in an exceptionally approachable showing of spirit-forward heat elevating a focused base profile.","Nov 29, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Florida,4.84/5,"Poured at 54°. Black body with a deep dark edge and good clarity under fast fizzy dark tan head which disappeared quickly leaving no cap retention but a solid ring and spots of lace, especially on agitation; thick legs on swirl. Nose is toasted marshmallow, bourbon and strong vanilla; sweet bourbon in the retro nasal. Vanilla and toasted marshmallow entry, some char, oak, chocolate and caramel; bourbon ever present; vanilla tootsie roll finish. Alcohol burn on tip of tongue; face flushing warmth from 16% abv; smooth rich velvety feel; almost full body, not adjuncty, just viscous with medium heft. Overall, an OMG beer for me; boozy yet balanced base and barrel flavors; love the charred oak and spicy bourbon notes; surprised and awed by how much vanilla aroma and flavor presents; layers of flavors which are both intense and complimentary.","Nov 06, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Delaware,4.5/5,"Pours black color with a beige-white head. Smell is of bourbon, dark chocolate, caramel and cherry. To me it tastes of bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, toffee, and cherry. I really liked this one.","Oct 17, 2022"

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Illinois,4.45/5,"500ml bottle, best by July 21, 2026, poured into a 2012 BCBS snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep black color, everything you'd expect from a BCBS entry, thick, oily, sludgy with a thin finger of tan head that fizzes out quickly with no retention nor lacing. The aroma is great, tons of oak barrel, earthy oak, musty, leathery, big char, toasted coconut and burnt dark chocolate, hot spirit that brings out toffee and brown sugar, vanilla, stone fruits and heavy grain. The flavors are good, lots of barrel, charred and burnt wood, toasted grain, leather, rich dark chocolate, stone fruits, warming spirit with brown sugar and caramel, fusel alcohol and a dry coconut forward finish. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy, heavier body with a more dry and warm finish.

Verdict: A nice rendition of BCBS from Goose Island. The barrel character is really prominent and offers a nice roast/toast/charred character to the beer. It definitely does skew towards a dry and more boozy experience but there is still a great depth and good balance.","Sep 24, 2022"

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Connecticut,4.6/5,"Not much in the way of head production or retention, unsurprisingly.

Nose is incredible and swimming in bourbon and booze. If you've had Bourbon County a hundred times before, this aroma brings you back to the first time you ever sniffed it.

Impressively easy drinking despite clocking in at 16% ABV. Not quite as thick and chewy as OG BCBS. Alcohol heat is reserved primarily for the back third and the effervescent finish.

Flavors are all over the place, in the best of ways. Oak, vanilla, coconut, sweet mash, chocolate, molasses, toffee, caramel, prune, cherry, almond, pecan. Once again, Goose Island delivers a rich, complex, nuanced, and incredible array of flavors without additives - nothing but beer and barrel.","May 22, 2022"

Oak, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and bourbon overwhelmed my senses in a beautiful way. The taste is quite complex. It has the BCBS familiarity, but is much more vibrant. Bourbon emerges immediately, but it transforms into sweet caramel, vanilla, spices, with a finish of raisin and honey. There is a hint of charcoal. It blends together well. It is unique. Delicious for sure. This is a special flavor. The mouthfeel is full-bodied, yet smooth, silky, boozy, with light carbonation. Overall, drinking this beer is an incredible experience.","May 02, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Washington,4.62/5,"Bottle Date: 2021
Palate Contaminants: none

Dark brown, and one can see through about half an inch of it. Virtually no head, though.

The smell is so good. It's like every mellow and sweet candy, and bar any cloying ones. The first thing that hits me is vanilla, real vanilla. Then there's savory caramel. It's slightly lactic, but possibly best described as light hot cocoa powder. As it warms, there's a little bit of spice, cinnamon and clove, but they're in the background.

That vanilla and caramel don't stand a chance against the strength of the other flavors. Underlying it all is a sweet grain flavor that absolutely reminds me of an aged, dark bourbon. The taste has a lot more fresh cinnamon spice, as well as freshly ground coffee. There's also a sarsaparilla or ginger element. Sweet, verging on very sweet. About the only fruit I get is smoky dates, yet not medjool, which is another surprise considering the level of sweetness. 

Very well integrated very fine carbonation, nowhere near prickly. The immediate aftertaste is honeyed, roasted grain, but the long aftertaste adds smoky butter cream. Maybe a little raisin toward the end. Alcohol is unavoidable, but everything that you'd want to taste puts that back in it's place.","Apr 24, 2022"

T - Complex but follows the nose: rich bourbon, chocolate, and oak throughout with vanilla, caramel, and marshmallow intermixed with hints of molasses, spices, some dried fruit, tobacco, brown sugar. Lots of roasted malts, but I'm not getting a huge amount of toast or char which is probably my only knock. 
F - Medium leaning on full bodied with light carbonation. Incredibly smooth. Usually I like a heavier mouthfeel, but this really suits the beer. 
O - Honestly one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had - every flavor mixes so well together. It's pretty close to perfection.","Apr 07, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,Michigan,4.73/5,"Serving: 16.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a GI 2015 BCBS snifter. Bottled on 7/21/21, making this just over 8 months old at this point.

A: Pours maybe slightly darker and thicker than this year's regular. 

S: Has a bit more age on the nose compared to regular. A lot more sweetness, vanilla and fig as well. Not as much char or smoke as I might expect. 

T: Little more char and toast on the flavor here. Strong vanilla, oak, dried fruits, raisins. Almost has a little chocolate cake kind of thing going on too.

M: Sadly comes in a little thinner here than I'd expect, maybe due to extra ABV? Though that extra booze is pretty well integrated as this is not an overly hot beer as you'd expect.

O: So this is my first experience with the Double Barrel, having missed out on the first edition. I did get to try a 2-year Reserve a while back, so I'm familiar with the extra aging process. Much like that beer, I think the extra time does this beer well. It can come across as just an aged regular BCBS, but there's a little more nuance than that. This hits you with a ton of extra fruits, vanilla, and a nice cake quality. It's surprisingly more sweeter. My only knock might be that I'm not actually getting a ton of the toast or char, but I'm not sure if that's intentional or not. Overall, this is a great variant and is a real nice subtle twist on Regular. 

Recommendation: While it may not be wildly different than regular (and certainly not worth the price increase), this double barrel variant is at least worth a try from hardcore BCBS fans.","Apr 02, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,New York,4.48/5,"16oz. tubed and capped bottle into a Founders snifter. Shared with schen9303. 

Pours dense. Very little mocha-colored head that collapses. Legs are thick and oily and really stick around. Stringy, spotty lace. Nose is booze, sweet molasses, sweet soy sauce, chocolate, and fudge. Some tobacco and oak in the back with some candied grape and raisin as well. Great complexity. Hugely aromatic. Beer opens chocolate, fudge, and sweet soy sauce. I get molasses in the middle with layers of booze, vanilla, lactose, and fudge. Oak, more booze, and tobacco at the end. Sweet syrup and more chocolate at the finish. This is great Body is full with low carbonation. Slick, oily, and hot on the palate and goes down warm and boozy. Oily, sticky aftertaste that lingers.

Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,New York,4.97/5,"Pours a dark as a black hole with a 1 finger brown foamy head that faded on the quicker side, leaving minimal lacing like most BCBS variants. Smells like vanilla, toasted marshmallows, molasses, brown sugar, charred wood, bourbon, oak, dark fruit, red wine like merlot and caramel. A lot going on but never coming off as too sweet while masking the ABV, this brew is full of barrel accents that make it rich and complicated with every whiff. It simultaneously presents it self as sweet, boozy and enticing as it allows the toasted barrels to shine through and let the vanilla and charred oak make this very different from the standard BCBS base beer. Perfection to inhale.

The charred barrels give off incredibly complex flavors, different from any other Bourbon County brew. The initial taste is a combo of vanilla, cocoa powder, bourbon, campfire toasted marshmallow, burnt coffee grinds, caramel, molasses, dark fruit, merlot or some other red wine, charred wood, brown sugar, and tobacco. The second wave of flavors includes herbal notes like tea leaf, espresso beans, port wine, a holiday fruit cake, oaky notes and booze like dark rum. There is no alcohol burn and the way all the flavors mesh together made this one of my favorite BCBS variants yet.","Mar 12, 2022"
Bourbon County Double Barrel Toasted Barrel Stout,,New York,4.74/5,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like dark chocolate, burnt marshmallow, dried fruit, oaky char, vanilla, Whoppers, roasted malt, caramel, and smoke.

These non-adjunct variants of BCBS are always going to be my favorite, and I really enjoy that they’re becoming a focus lately. The barrel character on this is absolutely stellar, with the beer giving off flavors of dark chocolate, caramel, lots of oak, spice, charred marshmallow, dried cherry, tobacco and smoke.

This is medium bodied, creamy, rich, and not super boozy.

It’s hard to pick which bottling of DB BCBS I like better - both are quite excellent.","Mar 07, 2022"

Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Brandy Barrels),,,5/5,"Absolutely delightful. Strong enough, and expensive enough, that this is a ""sometimes treat"". But it is the benchmark against which all other beers are measured.

I loved this so much.

Each year is slightly different. They all age wonderfully, but also slightly differently. I think the Brandy barrels are my favorite, and I think 2013 was my favorite around 2018.

In some ways, this is hardly a beer: it's not highly carbonated. But, god, I love this stuff.","Jul 29, 2021"

500ml cork and cage bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours brown in color with a bit of a ruby hue, one-finger foamy off-white head that has short retention

S- huge brandy notes on the nose, with aromas of raisin, figs, prunes, black cherries and dark grapes. Maple and toffee sweetness, along with brown sugar, peppery oak, toasted pecans and raisin bread. Has an overall port-like aroma

T- as with the nose, brandy dominates the flavor up front; a plethora of dark fruits including figs, dates, raisins and black cherries. Mid-palate gives notes of butter toffee, brown sugar, an umami-like soy, as well as a bunch of sherry and port-like notes. The finish gives notes of pipe tobacco, cherries, sharp oak and cracked pepper. Long linger of brandy 

M- medium body with low carbonation leads to an almost flat mouthfeel that continues into just a hint of foam into a warming, silky finish 

O- at nearly 10 years old, the complexity of this beer is through the roof. The brandy barrel takes front stage and compliments the base beer brilliantly","Feb 07, 2021"

2011 batch (I think this was the only year this was brewed?)

Dark brown, high viscosity, almost no carbonation. Hefty grape essence in the nose, warming alcohol, vanilla and caramel. 

Drier on the palate than the aromas - nice oak aging. Still, decadent desert flavors abound with sweet brandy essence combining with the stodgy malty character of Old Stock Ale. Nuanes of raisins, carob, vanilla. Thinner mouthfeel than expected ushers in a medium finish.","Nov 28, 2019"

Old Stock Cellar Reserve (Aged In Brandy Barrels),,California,4.49/5,"2011 poured in May of 2019. Nice pop when the cork came out. Pours a gorgeous dark brown with little head. Nose is brandy, port, raisins, oak, and maybe a touch of spice. The taste is great. Tons of flavor exploding on the first sip. Lots of brandy - the most I have tasted on a beer aged in brandy barrels. Lots of grapes, oak, candy, toffee, bread, and leather. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the alcohol is well hidden. This beauty has aged gracefully over 8 years.

UPDATE: 2020 poured in 2022. Poured from under fridge temp (I would say close to 50 degrees). Lots of head - after that dissipated I can see a nice brown color.

Nose is insane. Apricots, peaches, toffee, figs, chocolate, red grapes. What a great aroma. Definitely keeps me wanting to take another sniff!

The taste is super smooth and full of toffee, brandy, apricots, figs, prunes, tree bark, and a touch of tobacco. Wow - this is amazing. Lots of fruit and malty goodness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall, a wonderful variant of Old Stock.","May 25, 2019"

A: Pours a deep raisin color with a thin and short lived dark tan head that quickly faded into nothing. 
S: Oxidization sticks out to me the most on the nose with dominating notes of cardboard followed by slight sherry and slight soy sauce. I also get tons of leather, caramel, and brandy, with hints of toffee, and raisin. 
T: Rich and complex notes of sweet brandy over flavors of powdery chocolate, leather, toffee, tobacco, musty cardboard, and just a touch of soy. The finish is full of toasted marshmallow and raisin, and I get lingering flavors of oxidization and brandy in the aftertaste.
M: Thick body, heavy and slick mouthfeel with a kick of booze. Soft and fairly smooth carbonation. Flavors are intense and potent overall, with a bitter and boozy finish and tingly aftertaste.

S caramel, molasses, brandy with the booze included, tobacco, figs and raisins, vanilla, faint leather, heaps of maple, maybe a little oxidized but it works with the style, hard toffee and more barrel, smells impressive really 

T more booze and barrel, lots of burnt brown sugar, dried sugar coated fruit, more brandy, shes big no doubt but but I don't think I'd guess its over 15% 

M syrup but not overly thick, numbs the lips, slick in the mouth but my lips are stuck together, there's heat going down but its smashing my chest and brain for the most part, has raisin and brandy going long on the finish 

O I can't imagine how intense this stuff was fresh, shes drinking mellow but still has booze written all over it and could probably go another 5 years with no problem 

A five year old bottling that could easily sit down for another 5-10 years with no problem, even with 5 years on it you can still tell its a little rough around the edges. World class stuff that's truly meant to go the distance under the stairs","May 26, 2016"

Flavour is similarly complex with tons of honey, molasses, dark fruit and caramel, with lots of big brandy presence. At first it's got no booze and lots of complexity to it. As it warms, more caramel and heat comes out. Mouthfeel is full bodied, slick, viscous with a nice sweet molasses and brandy warmth on the finish.

Foggy Window,,New Hampshire,4.34/5,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/29/23. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass. Cap-tip to @franktank18 for his resourcefulness, incidental generosity, and just how murderous he looks in a tie.

Pours an opaque milky orange with two fingers of airy, whipped egg white-like foam. Retention is fairly decent, leaving a fizzy cap and sudsy, slippery lacing.

Nose is pretty faint but, what there is of it, seems to me sugary, candy-like. Aroma of lemon drops and orange LifeSavers.

Taste is less sweet than expected, drier and more tart. Tasting lemon rind, tangerine and gooseberries. Some astringency standing in for actual legitimate bitterness - but not such that I’d care to complain about it.

Feel is dry and drying, clean and maybe feeling a bit lighter bodied than it really is due to fairly aggressive bright and fizzy carbonation. There’s a mildly acidic and boozy smoulder in the gullet, not unexpected given the abv.

Overall, tasty and gone all too soon. In accordance with can instructions I shall now refrain from operating machinery for some appropriate period of time.","Sep 14, 2023"
Foggy Window,,Indiana,4.48/5,"Appearance - The beer was the expected hazy orange color with a fluffy white head topping in the glass.

Foggy Window,,Colorado,4.29/5,"so excited to finally be getting the chance to try this, these guys have a sterling reputation and this felt like a real treat, thanks to my beer friends for hooking it up, although i have to say the other half collaboration we had in the same session was just as impressive. the pour on this one is slightly brighter even though its a double, same straw to orange muted tone, but more lively, creamier head, and with just a little more luster overall. the nose is amazing, still citra forward but not as citra dominant as the regional flights collab, more of the nelson popping, big white wine, kiwi fruit, and lemongrass in the nose here, fresh as they come, and with some neat lime zest and lime leaf in the aroma too from the galaxy, lemon curd from citra, and an oily decadence on a pale grain base, mouthwatering. white wine, goldenrod, rainbow skittles, orange zest, really really good, and very robust, palate coating, flavor seemingly tied to the slick oils in this, soft from the grain without being heavy, and approaching dry on the swallow, probably a new school juicy ipa yeast strain, not unclean at all, but not neutral at all either. thankfully well carbonated, this never feels like too much, and the alcohol is invisible. very nice ipa here, i see why this has gotten famous, i would love to try the double dry hopped foggier window edition too! i dont generally rave about this style the way many do, but this is way up there with the best of them...","Dec 12, 2022"
Foggy Window,,Minnesota,4.52/5,"This is a hazy and murky looking beer. The color reminds me of pineapple juice. Looks kinda pulpy. The head is white, fluffy, cloud like, with small bubbles. 2 Fingers is the pour, and the head retention is long lasting, with amazing lacing that sticks to the glass like super glue. 
Very tropical aroma here. The aroma leans toward sweet tropical to me. Mango, and guava seem to be the main aromas, with a hint of pineapple in the mix. 
Taste - The flavor follows the nose and the hops are more sweet. Lots of mango and guava going on here. They hit hard and early on in the mix. The finish is more tart and a hint of bitterness, which leans toward pineapple. That flavor isn't too strong, but there. 
The body is pretty damn soft and juicy feeling. Not really boozy feeling at 8.1%. 
This is a very well made NEIPA. Impressed.","Dec 10, 2022"
Foggy Window,,Washington,3.88/5,"@BeerSnake1 sent this my way as part of a revenge-box during NBSBIF#16

Pours a pale orange/yellow that's very opaque, but lets a little bit of light through. Massive pillowy head that leaves gorgeous lacing down the glass. 

Nose offers creamy orange and mango and a touch of diesel. 

Flavour actually opens with some lightly grainy malts before the hazy hops take over. It doesn't bring the bright rich fruit forward that I anticipated, instead opting to mostly forgo the initial pulse, and slowly creep up to a pithy and underripe fruit bitterness that carries through to the finish. There's a little bit of spicy/papaya dancing in there as well, and that pithy citrus finish builds and builds and builds and tastes like I'm chewing on an orange rind by the time I'm halfway through the glass. 
Body is moderate and smoothe with a sticky bitter finish and a sharp carpet of carbonation.

Taste follows the nose with bright notes of orange, lemon, green grass, green onion, with an earthy woody note. Very mld bitterness. Minimal sweetness. Crackery malt backbone provides a nice canvass for the hops to shine on. That woody bitterness lingers into the finish. It provides a nice balance to the moderate sweetness.

Foggy Window,,California,4.39/5,"Canned 2 days ago. Pours a murky orange with white head. Definitely hazy! Nose is grapefruit peel, pineapple, apple, honey dew, pine needles, and a bit of leather. The taste is interestingly smooth. Not a huge hop bite on the first sip. Restrained. Definitely some citrus peel - grapefruit again comes to mind. Leather, dirt, a floral note, and more grapefruit on the aftertaste. In fact, the aftertaste is almost identical to the bitter grapefruits that I get from our tree in the backyard when they are a bit under-ripe. The pineapple is there on the taste, but it pales in comparison to what was on the nose. The hop bitterness definitely overshadows the tropical fruit on the taste.

Foggy Window,,Connecticut,4.11/5,"Canned on 7/13/20; consumed on 8/3/20

Pours an opaque pale gold body with multiple fingers of uniform, foamy white head; excellent retention yields a frothy ⅓ of a finger of cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a distance spread of webby/spotty lacing around the glass.

Aroma opens with notes of papaya meshing with a musty onion dankness, a contrast continuing to play out across the bouquet as the middle features jellied basil phasing into mango, with tropical cream deftly interwoven into the back end; hints of lychee and guava round out a further detailed, tropical close.

Taste starts off with tangerine and overripe pineapple as the tropical hops steadily transition to an earthy mid-palate of dried grass and wet basil; papaya and semi-sweet hop resin backed with musty melon and hints of white grape and orange zest progress and flourish on the finish.

Mouthfeel features a smooth, medium body persisting alongside a concentrated, prickly, moderate-high carbonation petering out steadily a creamy, resinous peak past the mid-palate disperses across the palate to an easy, quasi-bitter prickle through the finish, sparking a slightly juicy texture into the swallow.

On the cusp of absolute hop equilibrium, this one flashes refined elements that edge a beer toward perfection in the style; waves of fruity tones entangled with an eclectic array of well-defined, herbal hops sit atop an absolutely seamless body, and yet a persistently spotty, subdued character plagues the profile just enough to hinder this NEIPA from reaching a truly special, harmonious peak.","Aug 03, 2020"
Foggy Window,,California,4.18/5,"From tasting notes 12/13/19
Had on-tap at Monkish Brewing in Torrance, CA

Appearance - Served up in a tulip, hazy and light orange in color with a thin, broken layer of suds covering the surface. Lacing consists of broken lines and spotting.

Smell - Aroma hits on papaya, pineapple and a bit of orange. Maybe some faint leafiness, too.

Taste - Soft, tropical notes of mild pineapple, papaya and orange with a touch of mango. Pineapple bite becomes more assertive as it warms. Fruity, juicy finish.

Mouthfeel - Medium in body with fair carbonation. Soft, creamy texture as is that signature Monkish feel. Slightly dry finish.

Overall - A bit reserved in flavor at first, but blossoms nicely as it warms. Another great Monkish offering.","Jan 22, 2020"
Foggy Window,,Indiana,4.55/5,"Hazy straw color with a fluffy white head, it’s to style. What is beyond the style is the nose - this is a Citra hop sledgehammer between the eyes. Juicy ripe oranges, pineapple, grapefruit rind, passion fruit, mango, and a smidge of grape mist. WOW!

The taste captures the essence and substance of the aromas magnificently. This is ridiculously flavorful and yet perfectly balanced while retaining the mouthfeel you want in a beer like this, something difficult to do for many breweries.

Foggy Window,,Massachusetts,4.46/5,"Drank on tap at Monkish Brewing Co., Torrance, CA
Served in a tulip

Hazy, pale straw yellow appearance. Slightly short of cloudy. The body was topped by a bubbly, two-finger tall, off-white crown that slowly fell to a lasting collar. A patchy wall of lacing coated the glass and stuck around until nearly the drink’s end.

The aroma was really hoppy and bright. Citrus notes dominated. Loads of juicy orange. Mango was also noticeable. Bit of grapefruit too. As the beer sat, the nose mellowed out. Later, however, peach notes appeared and really took over. Somewhat sugary and sweet. Peach candy rings came to mind.

The flavor profile was quite similar to the aroma. Loads of juicy citrus notes. Freshly squeezed orange juice perhaps. Some tangerine too. Wheaty and lemony in the center. Grapefruit came through on the back end and the finish. Hint of pithy bitterness after the swallow.

Excellent frothy, fluffy mouthfeel. Somewhat lighter bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, fairly zippy effervescence that fluffed up really nicely on the palate.

Monkish make some of my favorite hoppy beers on the planet, and all five of theirs we sampled at the brewery were terrific. That said, Foggy Window did strike me as being somewhat less interesting than the others. For a “flagship IPA,” however, one cannot ask for too much more.","Aug 14, 2019"

S: very tropical and citrusy on the nose. Orange, grapefruit and lemon are in full force, with pineapple and mango playing support role. Slightly grassy with bright hop profile. 
T: amazing. Orange, lemon, apricot, pineapple and mango all present. It’s juicy initially but finishes with hints of grass and black pepper. After taste is citrusy and grassy with lingering sweetness. Nectar to my taste buds. 
F: also incredible. Soft, loft, fully and smooth. I can’t stress how soft it is. It is light on the tongue but has a heft to it without being oily and overly full. Lower end of moderate for carbonation. 
O: I can’t get enough of it, and I’m glad to finally be drinking it. A home run for monkish. I would drink again, recommend, and I’m very glad to try. Cheers!","Aug 03, 2019"

Maybe also some stone fruit. This is all Citra, all day long. A touch of bitterness on the tongue. Not overwhelming or sweet like some hazies can get. Crazy drinkable for the ABV.

The aroma is strongly orange rind, mild mustiness.

Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,,Massachusetts,4.17/5,"Canned a month ago, brewed in Brooklyn. Looks like a Trillium beer with a quickly dissipating fizzy head, most likely indicating the hopping intensity and amount of residual hop oils. Aromas are punchy, dank, and spicy. Mostly citrus. Flavors largely follow suit, with a decently sweet creamy malt bill that I assume is quite heavy on the flaked oats and wheat. Valencia orange is the primary flavor that comes to mind. Mouthfeel is fine although a bit residually sweet on the tail end. As usual, their Brooklyn-brewed stuff is noticeably better

Truth - Vanilla Bean,,Germany,4.25/5,"Pours onyx black with a dark brown film atop, which results in a small layer of lacing at the rim of the glass.

Aromas on this are defined by complex flowery and spicy vanilla, bakers chocolate and lighter molasses among a well accentuated, toasty, oaken barrel.

The beer’s mouthfeel is rich and decadent, smooth and heavy with a fitting lower carbonation, which manages to develop a late effervescence, leading to a pleasant refreshment.

Tastes of milk chocolate, spicy molasses and toffee, together with a warming, weatherbeaten, yet elegant, sweet and flowery appearing barrel. Got an earthy coffee bean dry- and roastiness going on, gently balanced by lots of soothing whipped cream and chocolate cake. Finishes with a warming, sweet spiciness, lingering, licorice accompanied vanilla bean and more chocolate among an evenly spicy, yet toasty maintaining barrel dryness.

Truth - Vanilla Bean,,New Jersey,4.94/5,"31 May 2021 - Beer #245

Price: $18.00 at the brewery

It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.

The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.

Appearance: 4 - definitely black, but poured a bit thin. Not much head.

Nose: 5 - oh my. No explosion in the nose, just smells very well blended and not too sweet.

Taste: 5 - hmm, really interesting. Not too much vanilla. The barrel really hits on the back end.

Mouth: 5 - much thicker than expected. Supremely smooth. Incredibly well crafted.

Overall: 5 - okay, I wasn't blown away. Could have used more vanilla, but I'm nitpicking.

Truth - Vanilla Bean,,Massachusetts,4.91/5,"Drank from a 12 oz. white wax dipped bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a Tree House teku

Viscous, complete pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid.

The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent.

The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow.

Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips.

Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy. I hope these guys continue to releases more barrel-aged bangers like this.","Oct 08, 2020"
Truth - Vanilla Bean,,California,4.63/5,"I wish it had a bit more vanilla and roastiness on the nose, but the flavor is so exquisite that I forget all about it.

It’s the best Tree House stout I’ve had.","Sep 28, 2020"
Truth - Vanilla Bean,,Massachusetts,5/5,"Lived up to expectations. Perfect blend of a fantastic tasty stout with just the right thickness and sweetness. Vanilla is just noticeable to bring great balance to the marshmallow and bourbon taste. The bourbon is noticeable from sip one and comes alive with that awesome bourbon burn on the tongue more and more as it warms - but never overwhelms. Always smooth, always a great mouth feel.

Truth - Vanilla Bean,,New Hampshire,4.75/5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (after 25 minutes of fucking with the wax thank you Tree House) into a stemmed harmony glass. Gotta keep it classy..

The pour is pitch black with a 2 finger effervescent milk chocolate head. The head quickly dissipates into a blanket of creamy foam. Doesn't leave any lacing but looks gorgeous after it settles.

The aroma brings notes of earthy oak, sweet bread, bourbon and vanilla before a wave of dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits. 

The flavor is definitely stupid. Lots of bourbon and vanilla on the front, followed by a tidal wave of milk chocolate, dark chocolate fudge, chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, caramel, sweet bread, and roasted coffee. There's some subtle notes of fig on the back. Wow.

The feel is about what you'd expect: Full-bodied and chewy as hell, creamy, syrupy and full of booze. One of the thickest beers I've ever drank. Ridiculous, but also extremely difficult to finish even a 12 oz pour.

Overall, this is the first BA stout I've ever had from Tree House, and...the 2nd they've ever brewed (not certain about that)? Regardless, it's pretty much what you would expect if you love TH stouts as much as I do. The bourbon is strong but never comes close to overwhelming the other flavors. Incredibly rich and full. The price point is hard to justify but it's absolutely worth trying if you can.","Sep 23, 2020"

Jammy,,Virginia,4.38/5,"Blend #2. 

A: Pours a deep, wine-like purplish red with a finger of fizzy pink-colored head. Fizzles out pretty quickly, leaving a ring. Nice effervescence. A few swaths of lacing.

S: Blackberry, redcurrant, fig, and an undertone of earth and funk. 

T: Moderately tart blackberry, tart cherry, and a hint of earth and white pepper. Though not super complex, the fruit and a light sweetness offsets the moderate tartness, making this pretty drinkable. 

M: Medium body, lightly creamy, with medium-high, somewhat sharp carbonation.

O: Jammy is spot-on as a descriptor for this beer. Delicious as a sour beer with loads of dark fruit, but missing the complexity that a larger Brett contribution would impart.","Mar 24, 2019"

Jammy,,Oregon,4.6/5,"Smell : Stilton cheese wheel. Blackberry jam. Sour grape skin. Light acetic tartness. Damp oak. Leather. Dirty sock funk. Yoghurt. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Feel : Medium-bodied. Sharp. Vinous. Slight creamy initial mouthfeel. Moderate sizzling carbonation.

Overall: Not quite what I thought this beer would be, especially since Side Project was involved in its conception. The cheese funk-yoghurt dichotomy is a force majeur that presides over the entire drinking experience; the cheese simmers down midway while the yoghurt intensifies as the brew gets warmer. In more familiar Casey fashion, the fruit is just one half of the blackberry yoghurt melange as opposed to the headline; unlike with CFP where the fruit dominates the aroma and flavor, the blackberry complements the funk almost effortlessly. The easiest way to describe it would be that the beer is like one of those yoghurt packets with fruit jam in the middle: the yoghurt is dominant until you dunk the spoon into the tub and mix the fruit around, except in this case mixing the fruit equals giving the beer time to breathe. Again, unusual yet delicious.","Jul 10, 2017"

Jammy,,Colorado,4.35/5,"this is one of the better blackberry wild beers i have ever had, but for me, its still a step behind how good the casey version was, they seem so radically different to me, a product of more than the age effects of the time gap between that one and this one i would think, the yeast seems entirely different. a deep concentrated berry color, almost looks like red wine, even more so when the head settles after a moment. aroma of straight fresh blackberries, smashed up but not cooked or sugared or preserved in any way, just smells like the fresh fruit. very little malt in the aroma here, but i get a nice tangy funk as well, sweeter than some of their other fruited beers, less sour. the flavor is great too, the blackberry really stands out, its sweet but its natural, almost too concentrated for the oddly subtle yeast flavors to completely be appreciated. this is bretty and woody, but its not overly nuanced from a wild yeast standpoint, and tastes far less complex and mature than the casey one did to me. there is a light pucker, but we didnt find this one to be super sour. the berries are really incredible, but it almost drinks like juice as much as it does beer. would have been cool to have both versions side by side. impressive use of this tricky fruit, stronger too than many of the others, great beer.

edit: i just had blend two, on tap, and i think i liked it better, still super intense fruit, darker still in color, but now more sour and evolved on the yeast side so it appears more balanced. maybe just that this is fresher than the first one was when i had it, but i think its slightly improved for the better. red wine abounds as well, and so much blackberry, its outrageous!","Apr 22, 2017"
Jammy,,Illinois,4.93/5,"SP version of the bottle drank at SP on 3/28/2017

I am going to start with the overall first because this one is very tough for me to not give 5s across the board. I guess to go relatively speaking I had to barely downtick look and smell. This is most definitely one of the best beers I have had and I will be doing what I can to get my hands on a bottle or two or hopefully drink it again at SP.

L-beautiful deep dark red, almost purple. Minimal head, but nice lacing. Almost syrupy looking.

S-I didn't get a ton of boldness on the smell. Definitely some barrel and fruits, but not quite the explosion of notes as in the taste.

T-flavor explosion! bursting notes of blackberry, red wine (i would guess something medium bodied like a malbec or pinot noir barrel but im horrible at that), and oak. Those are the key flavors to pinpoint but there is a nice level of complexity here too with some earthy tones, grass, and lemon. I should have taken better notes.

F-amazing! Berry Jam is a legit description. There is the perfect balance of tartness and crispness to this, and the bottle says it's a saison, not a wild ale. I would say that it is perfectly molded right between the two and that adds to the complexity of the flavors and feel. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING","Mar 31, 2017"
Jammy,,Oregon,4.52/5,"750ml capped bottle. Served in a Side Project stemmed glass, and side by side with the Casey version. Pours a darker purple body, somewhat opaque, one finger thick white head, great retention, not much lacing. Smells of rich blackberry jam, touch of lemon, moderate lactic acidity, oak and red grape skin. Nice red vinous character, honestly made me think this was a super jammy and sour pinot noir. Works great, and the smell fits the name. Jammy indeed. Flavour is similar to the nose, and it translates reasonably well. Jammy blackberry, tart blackberry skin, touch of lemon citrus, moderate lactic acidity, oak, and the red vinous notes are a bit less apparent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a touch undercarbonated, but it makes it so easily drank- I didn't realize it but I finished my glass of this well before I finished the glass of the Casey version side by side. Full depth, nicely bodied all the way through. Slight preference to this as while the nose and flavour were simply continuations of each other, it did the name justice a bit more so than it's counterpart.","Mar 26, 2017"

Jammy,,Missouri,4.37/5,"Shared with my wife at the Side Project Cellar on 2-10-17. Pours a very nice velvety shade of purple with the typical fluffy white head that is typical of almost all Side Project brews. Smells of funk and wood, with a background berry. Very strong sour dominates initially, gut that does subdue either as it warms, or as my palate gets used to it. A berry flavor is then exposed, with the wood from the barrel also being detected. 

My overall rating is not a reflection the beer itself, but more of the experience, so take it as that. The cellar itself was packed, so my wife and I ended up trying to enjoy the beer standing up with the bottle sitting on the small v-shaped outcropping right before the step. Couple that with the price point of the beer itself, and the fact that the bartender seemed a little irritated that I chose not to tip, yelling ""thank-you"" in what I took as a condescending tone to my back as I was walking the beer and 2 glasses to my wife. I mean, dear God lady, I just paid you $45.00 for a single bottle of beer that I will now try to ""enjoy"" with my wife while standing cramped up against a triangle and hand railing.","Feb 13, 2017"

Bad Boy,,Virginia,4.5/5,"From a month-old pint can, pours a very clear deep orange-gold. Smell and taste are very herbal and piney, with a touch of citrus. Bracing bitterness, but not excessively so. A big, unapologetic West Coast IIPA. Fantastic beer.","Oct 01, 2021"

Bad Boy,,Washington,3.64/5,"Nearly clear bright yellow brew with a thin cap of foam. Robust mouthfeel with super-sized malt. Aroma is mango. Flavors of dark orange, even some grapes. Rich and powerful with hot citrus.

Quite alcohol tasting. Boozy, as someone noted. Overall, this is a pretty no-nonsense blast of hops. I have never seen this in the San Diego area, and here it is at a supermarket in San Francisco. From the 22 oz bottle.","Jan 21, 2020"
Bad Boy,,Arizona,4.29/5,"On-tap at Chupacabra in Mesa, AZ:

Pours golden with a white head. White lacing sticks.

The smell is of huge tropical and citrus notes with some tangerine and pine that is musty in a good way.

The taste is of tropical and citric fruits, tangerine and a touch of pine. Some solvent alcohol, but overall the alcohol is well-integrated. Nice bitter bite in the finish.

Smooth - not too hot despite some noticeable alcohol (as expected for abv level).

A very enjoyable hop-forward imperial IPA!","Jun 22, 2019"
Bad Boy,,Colorado,4.27/5,"this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever, so it was awesome to finally get to try it, one of those beers of lore, always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be, and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago. now, it kind of just seems like another one. thats not a knock against it of course, it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined, less clear than what was popular at the time, but certainly not hazy for the sake of it, although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things. i love the hop complexion, i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy, its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets, the greenness, the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer. its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too, but there is a lot of orange juice, grapefruit zest, and pine needle character here, very northwestern to me, slick and oily feeling and dense as can be, almost woody like lumber, and with a lot of body too, its a big one for sure, perfectly appropriately named. the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool, its a long trajectory of flavors. citrus abounds as well later on, a honey taste and richness in the middle, and very good, although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years. i think, like pliny or something, that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was, but that does not diminish its excellence...","Sep 25, 2018"
Bad Boy,,Rhode Island,4.25/5,"Shared from a growler with Ryan. Pours a pretty hazy orange body. Fresh hops and piney resinous aromas, zesty citrus.

Smooth and easy, especially for 9%","May 12, 2018"
Bad Boy,,Massachusetts,4.47/5,"Parking lot share with George...pours a cloudy golden orange color. Nice and hazy! Aroma of pine, subtle citrus are abundant.

Bad Boy,,Washington,4.38/5,"Bottle Date: purchased a month ago
Palate Contaminants: a pizza with some liquid smoke

The look is dark straw, with a nice amount of fine white head. A little opaque, but it does let plenty of light through.

The smell is delicious sweet pears. There's also a little pine sap and some pineapple sharpness. It's not super complex, but what's there is really good.

There's little grapefruit, which is a surprising. Mostly pear, but some peach, too. The pineapple doesn't carry over. Non-sweet grapes of some undetermined variety join in. There's more earthiness than on the nose, but it's always in the background. It's balanced, overall. Slightly acidic, slightly sweet, moderately savory, and moderately bitter. I could see it supplementing a salty cheese well, but that's not actually one of the flavors I get.

Carbonation is very well integrated. Moderate-heavy thickness for the type. Savory aftertaste with grape leaves and woodsiness.","Jun 17, 2017"
Bad Boy,,Illinois,4.35/5,"about a 3 week old bottle drank on 6/6/2017

I've been seeking this one out for a while and I can certainly see why this was in a league of its own when it was first released. The piney, dank, citrus combo is really nice, it's incredibly drinkable, and somehow there's very little bitterness while the ABV is quite high. I really enjoyed this one as this showcased the west coast style very nicely.","Jun 07, 2017"
Bad Boy,,Massachusetts,4.65/5,"Another great Alpine IPA. These guys do an awesome job. Had this one a few months back and it was super fresh, super dank, great piney taste and hops came off with a perfect bite.","Nov 24, 2016"

Bad Boy,,Georgia,4.71/5,"Probably my favorite beer that I've had from Alpine. Danky pine and citrus goodness, with a good mouthfeel and crisp finish.

Bad Boy,,Nevada,4.49/5,"Dark ipa almost, dark orange and tan notes create an impressive head that holds its own for a few minutes. Aroma seemed to be somewhere along the lines of citra, summit, amarillo and simcoe. 

All the usual Alpine hop flavors, fruit, hides alcohol, pine, mary jane, mango. Extremely crisp and dry finish. Just another excellent big dipa from Alpine, all the usual feels. Not as good as Nelson though.","Jan 07, 2016"
Bad Boy,,California,4.87/5,"From a growler. Fresh fresh fresh! Hop aromas are pretty floral and fruit-forward. Plenty of biscuity grain detectable. Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater. Grassy on the back end, seems like a hallmark of Alpine. Mouthfeel is smooth with a distinctive tongue tickle. Way too drinkable for how strong it is. Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner.","Dec 27, 2015"

Taste: best part of this beer by a landslide. how is it 9% ? nobody knows. well, at least i dont. 

Feel: perfect mouthfeel for a beer of this style. Medium, maybe slightly medium plus.

Overall: more people should try this beer. It's the best hoppy beer / imperial IPA in CA, and probably whole West Coast.

Thank goodness it was available a few days ago when I visited SD and this brewery for the first time.

This beer is epic. just drink it and you will know.","Jul 08, 2015"

Hold On To Sunshine,,Pennsylvania,4.56/5,"Poured from 16oz can into pint glass in February 2023, that I purchased at their brewery in Charlton, MA. There is a date of Winter 2023 on the bottom of the can, and I drank this about 1 month after I purchased it. 

Appearance: Very dark black with 1-finger head. The head was dark brown, and disappeared after a minute. It left only a little lacing on the glass, and no head remained after a minute.

Smell: Strong mix of aromas filled the room as soon as the can was opened. Roasted coffee, caramel, and chocolate aromas. Not much hop style citrus or pine aromas.

Taste: There is taste of coffee, chocolate, and licorice. Also, some vanilla, peanut butter, and roasted malt flavors. They are more balanced than I expected from the aroma. Flavors are very bold. There is a strong alcohol presence that matches 7.6% advertised. A sweet chocolate, and vanilla aftertaste with edge of coffee, that is really enjoyable.

Mouth-feel: Very thick, but with an extremely smooth and creamy body.

This is a very good Porter, and one of the best Porters I have ever drank. It has a variety of flavors that adds a nice complexity to the beer. The balance of flavors is outstanding. The flavors of coffee and roasted malt nicely balance the bitter coffee with the sweet chocolate and caramel flavors. This is even better than the Tree House Cartharsis Porter, which is very good. This is very smooth and enjoyable to drink. I have enjoyed all the beers I've bought at Tree House, and I would buy this again.","Feb 26, 2023"
Hold On To Sunshine,,Pennsylvania,4.08/5,"Dark brown with a half finger of audibly fizzy dark khaki head that quickly settles into a lasting crown. No real lacing.

Roast peanuts, peanut butter, roasted malt and quality breakfast blend coffee in the aroma.

The taste spotlights peanut butter, very light chocolate and caramel and some roastiness from the complementary coffee. 

Creamy, full bodied feel with a mouth-coating oiliness and light zip to the carbonation.

Peanut beers aren’t my thing, but this is a very nicely made one.","Feb 20, 2023"

Hold On To Sunshine,,Pennsylvania,4.56/5,"16 oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a nice head. Nice peanut butter backbone running through this, to compliment the overrriding chocolate flavor. Reminds me of an imperfect peanut better cup. Very enjoyable stout.","Aug 01, 2022"
Hold On To Sunshine,,Germany,4.59/5,"6 months old. Can to tumbler.

Look: Pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. A lot of very fine floaters visible.

Smell: Peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. Almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.

Taste: Peanuts, chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet, somehow roasty and minimally bitter.

Feel: Creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. Quite smooth.

Overall: No barrel-aging, no double digit ABV, but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. All flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. There are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one I‘ve had so far.","Jun 16, 2022"
Hold On To Sunshine,,Indiana,4.34/5,"Viscous and oily looking with light brown foam that settles into a thick ring with a few patches of lacing. Chocolate malts, lactose, Cocoa, and a bit of dry roasted peanuts. I’m not a huge fan of lactose in general, but here it does ok. Well carbonated and creamy. Overall really tasty, but not mind blowing in any way. I would definitely buy it regularly if it was available in my area.","May 09, 2022"
Hold On To Sunshine,,Maryland,4.67/5,"16 oz can poured into a tulip pint glass. Pours pitch black with a surprisingly large mocha head. Good retention. Aroma and flavor feature dark chocolate, creamy peanut butter, dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, vanilla, and some earthy hop presence. This has to be the perfect peanut butter cup beer: not too sweet, real peanut butter flavor, not too strong abv-wise. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and not boozy. Overall it's a shockingly good beer and a real treat to drink.","Apr 29, 2022"
Hold On To Sunshine,,Pennsylvania,4.34/5,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Indicates YEAR THREE on the can with a date of 1/7/22, so this is being consumed at just after 3 months.

Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind. Looks stunning.

Smell: The aroma is wonderful. This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also. There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout.

Taste: Interesting. It is much sweeter than I was expecting. And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout. I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is. The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma. Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me. The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor.

Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick. This is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is spot on. Really nice.

Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing. One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV. Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout. It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me.","Apr 08, 2022"
Hold On To Sunshine,,New Jersey,4.52/5,"16 ounce can in a tulip stout glass. Exactly 30 days since canned.

Opaque black crude oil color with a near 3f dark tan cap. A ring remains and leaves splashes of lacing. A beauty.

Smoky roasted malt aroma with peanut butter, chocolate, and fresh roasted coffee.

It tastes like a peanut butter, chocolate, and roasted coffee mix over a campfire. Nice.

Palate friendly full body and flavors. No sign of its 7.6% abv. Very rich and roasted.

Before opening, I let this sit for an hour after removing from the fridge. The temperature enhanced its aroma and feel. Rich and creamy peanuts and chocolate. Not built for every day drinking but so good.","Dec 13, 2021"

A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a less than one finger, light brown head, low retention, and sudsy lacing.
S: Aromas of chocolate malted, cherry, plum peel, peanut, and ?maple.
T: Very sweet with lactose flavor unquestionably an element. Flavors largely reflective of the nose; somewhere between a Hershey's® bar and chocolate soda with a brief pit stop at pure cane sugar. Bitterness sufficient to keep the sweetness from becoming cloying. Nutty, but no hint of coffee on the nose or palate.
M: Full bodied with moderate effervescence. Rich and tangy.
O: Full disclosure, I am a dry stout enthusiast and milk stouts are not typically my favorites, but I could see this being served in lieu of dessert.","Mar 13, 2021"
Hold On To Sunshine,,New York,4.31/5,"I like it as a PB stout...definitely one of the better tasting substyle of milk/sweet stout. As a milk/sweet stout it does a good job as well. It's hard not to just C+P my review of Gunner's Daughter here because I think the two beers are that similar except for a couple alcohol percentage points and slightly thicker feel from HOTS. 

A: Dark wood, burnt walnut...charcoal. Moderate-deep khaki foamline head. Very fizzy for a stout with lactose. 

S: Earth, peanut shells, black dirt, fruity coffee, English toffee.

M: Sweet and sticky with a slight drying edge. 

T: Like eating a full Reese's cup after taking a shot of espresso, which i just did for comparison purposes. Overall, the chocolate is more enduring than chocolate. Red berry chocolate fruitiness counterbalances the earthy peanut. Dryness of the short espresso. 

O: It's a good beer, but ranks behind pretty much every other stout I've had from TH. It's one of those beers that if I had access to routinely NBD, but not necessarily worth a repeat trip. Especially since Gunner's Daughter is such a good comp minus some sticky mouthfeel.","Feb 01, 2021"

M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation

O: A very good coffee and peanut butter milk stout that fires on all levels. Perfect balance between all of those aspects which makes it super easy to drink, especially at 7.6%. Definitely worth checking out","Jan 27, 2021"

Large coffee at the front of the nose, with a bit of underlying sweetness. A hint of peanut was also present.

Same on the tongue, with the coffee being really powerful.

The body was a bit light for a stout, but was smooth, and had a semi-sweet finish.

Drinkability was OK, would have been better with less (or no) coffee.

Overall, a well-made brew, but not one that was particularly enjoyable for me. YMMV.","Sep 26, 2020"
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,Illinois,4.41/5,"22 oz bomber (2015)

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout. 

S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact. 

T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal. 

M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well. 

O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer.","Feb 06, 2022"
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,New Jersey,4.64/5,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.","Apr 19, 2020"
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,Pennsylvania,4.56/5,"Look - Very little head with almost zero retention, and no signs of much carbonation. Opaque black in color.
Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles.
Taste - An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon. The chiles were quite noticeable, but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat. The same can be said of the bourbon. 
Feel - Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable.
Overall - The aroma and flavors were so big and well balanced that I found myself focusing almost purely on those aspects. I would have enjoyed a bit more body on the palate, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment. This is among the best beers I've had to employ chile peppers.","Apr 19, 2020"
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,Illinois,4.27/5,"12oz can, dated 01.29.2020, 2019 vintage stamped on the side of the can, poured into a 14oz brandy snifter.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin half finger of khaki head that recedes quickly, yielding no film nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, tons of fudge and chocolate, light pepper heat, tons of cinnamon, modest barrel, a nice oakiness with a good char and a bit of vanilla. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, brownie batter and fudge but also a nice bitterness, dry cinnamon, light pepper heat with a super smooth bourbon character, lightly charred oak, modest roast with nice hearty grains and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy, chewy but smooth and it coats very well with a warm but creamy finish.

Verdict: A very nice adjunct forward barrel aged stout from Spiteful. A great chocolate forward experience that is well balanced and accentuated by the cinnamon and pepper interplay while the vanilla tames the barrel, which isn't too hot and offers even more nuanced character.","Feb 15, 2020"

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,Ohio,4.08/5,"Black with a slow to build fizzy tan blanket that dies off quickly.

Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper.

Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing, with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity. Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately light-bodied stout. There's a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot. The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout, with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semi-dry.

This is like an older school, more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that don't overpower. Additionally--a shocking note for this day and age--it's not cloying. The only thing I'm not really experiencing here is any barrel. Not even a boozy heat.","Jan 11, 2019"

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,Illinois,4.58/5,"Seems like there is decent variance between batches, the one I tried was wonderfully balanced between the bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, peppers, cocoa, and wood. Smell was hypnotically good with all of these flavors. Taste was boozy yet dry, spicy yet sweet, heavy yet thin, love that complexity, especially for a style that usually hit you across the face in simple flavors.

It retains all the 5’s for me but drops on look and feel a bit. It’s thinner than my favorite stouts basically.

Thinner mouthfeel than I'd typically prefer, but this works as the taste is a memorable one that follows the nose.

black body with thin cap of head. Smells of bourbon, chocolate, peppers, and cinnamon. Taste is much the same. The flavors are extremely well integrated together. Bourbon is mellow yet flavorful. This beer really tastes great when it hits room temperature that is when the mouthfeel is really oily and the beer super smooth.

Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,,Illinois,4.83/5,"Ever since trying the original version, I've wanted to see what a barrel-aged version would do to a beer that I thought was already excellent, and an Abraxas competitor. 

The answer to what a barrel does to this beer: Essentially perfects it. The spice from the original is toned down and the bitterness hidden, and the strong cinnamon flavor is integrated into the beer better.

This was in my top 3 at Stout Fest, and my girlfriend's overall favorite. Barrel-aging takes what was already a great beer, and eliminates what I would think most would consider its potential flaws (acidic spiciness and cloying cinnamon). Very impressive beer by Spiteful, and one that holds its own against the top tier BA stouts.

God Damn Delightful Day 2016 batch - Still a delicious beer, but seems to be slightly less sweet (and maybe a little thinner) than last year, to its detriment. I'd almost like to see Hostile Harry given the BAMCC treatment, because it's fuller and sweeter, and might do some great stuff with the Mexican hot chocolate flavors. Either way, still an excellent beer, just not an all-time great like I thought last year's was.","Mar 15, 2015"

Appearance: Black (only appears very dark brown at the edges if held up to a light) with a medium sized dark beige head which stuck around for a while.

Smell: Moderate Bourbon, brown sugar, mild vanilla and perhaps the faintest hint of tequila. A nice smelling IS.

Taste: Fairly prominent Bourbon, mild tequila notes, brown sugar, chocolate, and roast malt notes. The beer is mildly sweet, but the tequila notes and tannic oak notes help the beer finish fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Subdued alcohol presence for the ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,,Nevada,4.14/5,"There's been a weird undercurrent the last few years that 'there aren't good tequila aged beers'. This, central waters and fiftyfifty often come to mind when I hear that aforementioned incorrect opinion. Had this at the very first Firestone Walker Invitational. Quite the nice find. Did they also bring it to the Bistro's barrel aged festival a few years ago? I dunno, you always remember the first and then after that its like ""meh"". 

Anyways, pours black, had a very thin head on tap. Aroma gave off a nice mild tequila and wood presence, I thought it was cool. The taste took on a smooth, sweet tequila and low roast low bitterness kind of stout beers. A mix of different mild sweeteners, brown sugar, agave, vanilla = smoov just doin' his thang. Its a rather creamy beer that doesn't get bogged down in being oversweetened, fully hits the sweet spot but doesn't go beyond. 

Its pretty good stuff and I could easily see dropping a nice penny to have this again. Its unique and very good.","Dec 31, 2018"

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,,Washington,4.47/5,"On tap at the Apex the other day.

The beer pours a blackish brown color with pretty good head retention and lacing. The nose on this beer is pretty fascinating, as I get considerable tequila, along with milk chocolate, vanilla and coffee. In combination, I ended up picking up something of blackberry and blueberry flavor that was very nice. The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, though the tequila wasn't as noticeable. Mouthfeel was very full, with a soft and creamy finish. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, and so drinkability is exceptional.

Excellent beer, and one that is all too easy to just gulp down. Have not had many tequila barrel aged beers, and most that I have tried have not been all that great. This version is one of the very best.","Jun 14, 2018"
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,,California,4.61/5,"Enjoyed from the bottle at Toronado SD, 9/12/17. Poured into a house bulb. Nose is subdued barrel: vanilla, chocolate, caramel. I want to say port-soaked buckwheat too, but I never would have pinpointed that if I didn’t already know it was a buckwheat stout. Can tell it’s not a bourbon barrel beer, but wouldn’t have suspected tequila. No heat. Palate starts with vanilla and caramel, then adds chocolate, and finishes with port flavors. Very elegant beer; slightly thinner-than-expected mouthfeel at first but ultimately perfect for the flavor profile. Tequila presence there but none of the typical barrel flavors that in my mind ruin other tequila-barrel stouts. Gets even better as it warms; getting some nice nutty flavors on the finish now. Wonderfully rich without being sludgy; a must try. Get it before it goes extinct.","Sep 12, 2017"

Feel- Between medium and full body, average carbonation, moderately bitter, mildly sweet, moderately mouth coating, moderately mouth warming.

Overall- Black with medium brown frothy head and above average head retention and lacing. Bouquet was medium in strength and dominated by toasted oats with notes of cacao and toffee.

Molasses, chocolate covered cherries, medium-roast coffee, maple candy, and complex malt in the nose. 

Stale coffee, milk chocolate, weak tobacco, and brown sugar on the palate. Low bitterness, faint grapefruit, but the hops have faded. Flavors are good but a bit flat, though there are few other signs of oxidation. Medium finish with malt balls, loam, and plum pudding.

Nose isn't up to the same level as the look, but it's still really nice, highlighted by loads of chocolate, toffee and faint roast. Taste largely follows, but with much more roast & coffee. Body is not quite as hefty as I anticipated. I want to say it's light, but it also feels like a milkshake, and those two things don't seem to make sense together, so I'm not sure how to describe it.

Darkness,,New Jersey,4.54/5,"(bomber, black-waxed, Darkness 2020; purchased off shelf at Shangy's last week... poured into my Trillium fat tulip)

L: tight, creamy dark tan foam; dark brown liquid, bordering on black, opaque... head recedes into a splotchy cap and smeared collar, but it laces lots in jagged, fingery-flecked bands

S: mint and espresso overtones; bittersweet dark chocolate... slowly emerging hints of roasted grains, alcohol, Irish Cream qualities... a few beats later, charred and deeply toasted, caramelized grain... kind of an overall typical RIS aroma profile; tonic, outdoorsy top notes; perhaps short of cinematic in scope, but nonetheless invigorating

T: big burst of bold flavors: espresso, toffee, molasses cookie... sweetish, roasty, residual underbelly and lightly campfiery, roasted nutty overtones in the aftertaste; big burp after a minute brings up sweetish, sooty dark chocolate... second big sip, more of a rounded malt character, with the interplay, contrast, and divide of heavy roast and rich crystal malts more stark; still little booziness, but some delicate spicy phenols and dark dried fruit notes starting to surface, and not long after some subtle black licorice... hop herbality finally opens up, rising above the burnt bliss of sugars below

F: cooling quality to its aromatics... slick velvet texture... lithe levity despite its luscious lines... medium-full bodied, bordering on the latter... malt milk, attenuated and accentuated by the balance of booze; dark nog, rib-sticking... maybe it's the 2 years on this, but it's heaven to my senses

O: not the most nuanced, but a pretty darn solid RIS... its sweetness is a touch more redolent than most style examples but luckily the roasted barley and hop bitterness are as intense, lending some needed balance... as expected, its high marks are likely because of its relative unavailability; this was the first time (along with Abrasive) that I've encountered it out this way, so I was easily compelled to buy a bottle (2086)","Feb 05, 2023"

Darkness,,Massachusetts,4.34/5,"2021 vintage

I’ve been sitting on this one for a minute now and I’m excited to finally try it. An absolute classic RIS, and one that totally caught me off guard when I saw it at the store, just sitting on the shelf. This is also my first beer from Surly so I’m even more hyped. Let’s tackle this massive beast

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

There’s still a solid bitterness to this for being 2 years old which is quite surprising to me. I’m picking up on aromas of leafy hops, burnt caramel, molasses, dark chocolate, charred wood, dark roast coffee, light vanilla, and red grape

While still bitter in taste, it feels like it’s integrated much better than the nose. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, cocoa powder, charred malt, caramel, vanilla bean, black cherry, sweetened coffee, light earthy hops, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of res grape, black cherry, molasses, milk chocolate, light roast coffee, leafy hops, vanilla bean, sweet caramel, and charred malt

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and lightly boozy beer. Finishes a tad sticky but dries out over time

Darkness,,Pennsylvania,5/5,"Straight 5s. Sublime is my word for 2023 and it applies here. Labeled a RIS, this is not the traditional version.

Consumed 10/31/22

What better beer for Halloween than the original Darkness?! I’m surprised I haven’t written a review for this beer yet considering how much I’ve always liked it and how long it’s been around. This is the first time I’ve gotten regular Darkness in a can, and I am happy to see the switch. Now I can buy more and actually drink one by myself! 

So it’s a perfect looking stout. Deeply black and some creamy (almost) looking lacing that stays after the pour. It’s nice and thick and creamy and full bodied as a great stout should be. It’s certainly less syrupy and motor oily than a barrel aged stout, but that’s appropriate. The thing I love about Darkness is that it’s not sweet. I crave the bitterness of a proper RIS. 2022 version (and all before really) knock it out of the park. Never pass on it and I hope this style stays prominent.","Oct 31, 2022"

Darkness,,New York,4.04/5,"Pours a deep, inky black from the can, moderate tan head with good lacing for ABV. Nose is big on bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla, an alcohol heat. Taste is very barrel and heat forward; big notes of spice as well, almost chile-like, though only a suggestion from the booze. Dark chocolate and sweet fruit round things out. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with only light carbonation. Very solid, but hard to separate it out from the rest of the BA Stout field.","Oct 08, 2022"
Darkness,,,5/5,Truly a tremendous stout. I’m enjoying the 2020 vintage. I won’t repeat the reviews that have already been posted here. They ring true.,"Sep 03, 2022"
Darkness,,Pennsylvania,4.36/5,"Darkness (2020) from Surly Brewing, Gorgon label with black wax. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees. 
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy. 
Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.
Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.
Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!","Jul 09, 2022"

Darkness,,New Jersey,4.42/5,"2020 release. Poured from undated bottle into a pint glass. It pours a dark mahogany with a full finger of luxurious, creamy, light mocha head and very thick lacing. It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char. The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome. It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific. Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming. Overall, Darkness is an extremely well crafted RIS and deserves its World-Class rating.","Apr 30, 2022"

Flavor: The flavor is dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, very noticeable cherry, perhaps some dark fruits, raisins, plums, ending in a grassy and grapefruit rind like bitterness. Very flavorful. Slightly bitter, no alcohol flavor, very complex.

Darkness,,Arkansas,4.92/5,"2016 Cerebus bottling.

Opaque in the glass, nice 2 fingers of head. 

Aroma of dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, sambuca, molasses, sweet dark fruits. 

Velvety smooth in the mouth, has a good amount of weight to it as well.

Tastes just as it smells, this is Russian Imperial Stout decadence here. Dark chocolate present throughout the palate, the molasses and sambuca are more mid palate, and the sweet finish of dark cherries and currants are a lingering treat in the finish along with that dark roasted malt. 

Aging for over 5 years likely softened any alcohol heat and made for a delicious and decadent stout that does not disappoint, even with sky high expectations going in. I also have a 2020 bottle I will be comparing it to soon.","Jan 24, 2022"
Darkness,,Massachusetts,4.54/5,"2021 Vintage

APPEARANCE
Pitch black body and a hefty three fingers of fluffy, tan-colored head

AROMA
An onslaught of leather, coffee, black licorice, tobacco, char, cherries. I mean, it goes down the list of everything you want in a superior RIS.

TASTE
Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.

MOUTHFEEL
Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.

Smell - The spice and delicious tequila were apparent in the nose. 

Taste - At the front, I was made to think of spicy cinnamon chocolate cookies. Notes of raisins, ancho chili, and tequila follow. There was even a hint of lime. After a few sips, heat built up in the throat in the aftertaste. 

Mouthfeel - The body was smooth and thick, perhaps just above medium bodied. Carbonation was noted. 

Overall - I love tequila aged stouts.","Nov 25, 2022"
Leche Borracho,,Illinois,4.23/5,"Matte black with brown speckling and head. This strikes me as a more chocolatey and spicy westbrook mexican cake, plus bourbon and tequila backing obviously. Nice “French toast effect” with cinnamon, some light caramel within the chocolate in the taste exclusively. Smooth feel in between pepper spice hits, well done by the way, and the spiced textures of the cinnamon. Taste is more clear in the flavors, where smell is amalgamation of it all. Would take mexican cake over this, but still very good","Sep 29, 2022"

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind

S- aroma is rich with chocolate, cinnamon and chili pepper up front, followed by undertones of creamy lactose, vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. The tequila barrel comes across as a mezcal-like aroma, with some oaky bourbon juice in the background

T- rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin. Mid-palate brings out the barrel notes; tequila takes center stage, with some oaky bourbon complimenting. The finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate, with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose

M- medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish. Some pepper heat pokes through after the finish

Leche Borracho,,Indiana,4.56/5,"Brew: Bottle Logic Brewing – Leche Borracho

Intro: 500 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend. 

Appearance: Dark black color. Minimal head but some. Same with the lacing as we drank

Smell: Cinnamon up front followed closely with chili pepper, Bourbon brings up the back end.

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Chili pepper is strong for my tastes.

Mouthfeel: Creamy but the chili holds that in check. Medium mouthfeel

Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s not my favorite selection from Bottle Logic

Conclusion: I’ve had several other Bottle Logic brews and this would not be in my top 4 or 5. It is mostly because of the chili pepper but that is personal taste. I am a big fan of the brewery, just not this particular beer. It’s still finely crafted and is deserving of the score given","Jul 23, 2021"
Leche Borracho,,Ohio,4.9/5,"Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer.","Apr 24, 2021"

Leche Borracho,,Ohio,4.45/5,"A 2018 release packaged in a 500ml bottle.

While filling the teku halfway, it is a viscous stout that produces a fairly frothy, brown head that not only has great retention, it never disappears. There is a constant film on top that tapers up to a thicker, cap sized ring around the glass. 

First thing I can smell is definitely cinnamon. Tequila is also noticeable. To me it seems more like a white tequila because I tend to think it gives off more gin like floral notes. Otherwise there is a hint of a sriracha like pepper sauce, and chocolate. 

Wow. The flavors really pop. A bit of tequila (aged this time) up front followed by chili peppers that deliver way more flavor than heat, but just enough bite to offset the sweetness and play off the, by far most dominant, flavor of cinnamon that is there throughout. It rounds off into a cocoa powder like chocolate with a touch of smokiness and lingering baking spice. As it warms, there is some vanilla in the finish too. Very nice combination of flavors. My only knock would be the sweetness starting to creep up the ladder as I make my way through it. 

The body stands out the most. Which was the case for the very first beer I ever had of theirs. I said at the time that they were in the league of Bourbon County and Firestone Walker. Lush, velvety, and significant, yet so easy to drink. There is some tingling from the peppers. 

Personally, I think that a touch more heat would put this right there, if not ahead of Mexican Cake for the best spiced stout I have had, but it is definitely at a level that it should appeal to everyone.","Jun 02, 2019"

Flavor: The flavor is chocolate, cinnamon and sugar, some pepper, and maybe vanilla, and a hint of bourbon and tequila. It is both very good and very complex but a bit too sweet.

Feel: It is fairly thick and viscous, but not as thick as some other imperial stouts I've had.","Jan 10, 2019"
Leche Borracho,,Virginia,4.41/5,"2018 release.

A: Pours jet black with a ring and smattering of medium-light brown, fizzy head. Recedes quickly to a ring. No lacing. 

S: Herbal (?) tequila, cinnamon, dark cocoa, spicy pepper, dusty oak barrel.

T: Pretty spot on for Mexican hot cocoa: cinnamon, cocoa powder, mild burnt char, sweet and lightly spicy pepper. A bit of sweet bourbon and some tequila, esp. on the finish. Wonderfully integrated and a nice, moderate lingering sweetness that’s appropriate for the hot chocolate thing.

M: Full bodied, chewy, with medium-light carbonation. Mild alcohol burn. 

O: Flavors are well balanced and everything comes together very nicely.","Jan 07, 2019"

S: Aromas of cinnamon, bourbon, chocolate, dates, molasses, nutmeg and subtle milk sugar sweetness. Great smelling and not boozy. 
T:Man this is unique. The thing that stands out to me is it is so flavorful even when cold. Tons of chocolate and cinnamon up front. The pepper spice is noticeable but it ins't overly done, just perfectly implemented on the finish. The lactose is prevalent as well, giving a milk complexity to the flavor reminding me of horchata. The tequila barrel is present on the initial profile but the finish is all bourbon. Fantastic. 
F: Full in body, medium to heavy in weight. Nice smooth feel with decent heft. 
O: An incredible offering from BL. I am super glad to try it on tap, and can't wait to see how it fares from the bottle. I am very glad to have tired. For the record, the wife approves of this beer (which is saying something as she isn't a stout drinker). Cheers!","Jan 06, 2019"

As a big non-fan of tequila-barrel beers, I'm happy to report that the barrel plays well with the rest of the beer, and overall the flavors integrate better than I expected they would.

Smell blends charred oak and charred chilies to a point where they're indistinguishable from each other, and the chilies are near smoked chipotle levels. Smooth dark chocolate quickly mixes in, bringing plenty of cinnamon, a little vanilla nougat, almond, and a hint of strawberry.

Taste is chocolate chip cinnamon raisin cookies with a touch of sweet chili, red fruit, sweet vanilla and brown sugar. A hint of toasted graham emerges as it warms, as well as some root beer, with a little agave in the finish, but there is not much barrel present whatsoever.

This one's thin, fizzy, wet and slick.","Jul 05, 2017"
Crusher,,Maryland,4.55/5,"Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Canned June 21st 2023.

Hazed and opaque body with a muted orange but fairly dark and still. A mix of custard but has a much darker than expected color. The beer nearly appears frozen. Head is quite soapy, fine white bubbles of three fingers with light retention. Shampoo like top but lots of ring lacing to match.

Aroma is a hop surprise. Hints of soft dank, but a real gumdrop like candy sweetness that matches nicely. Thick and rich, with a light sense of sweet malt to counter as well. The contrast between dank and sweet hop aroma on this is exceptional. Huge juicy dank sweet punch is the only way I can describe it, like hop thick Kool-Aid.

Palate brings things a little more into focus, but does not hold back. Mid palate hits with a hot but delicious earthy mid palate punch. Large and bold, but controlled hop blasts of pine, earth, juiced candy orange pineapple and mango rolling into a minty finish that just does not quit. It doesn't stop there, with a creamed earthy mouthfeel that feels like a sundae, and smells like sweet tilled garden earth.

Crusher,,Massachusetts,4.65/5,"Picked up fresh from the brewery in December 2019 by a wonderful brother as a Christmas gift.

Crusher,,New Jersey,4.35/5,"Yeah, this was old but like so many cans in my stash, I have no idea when this was brewed as there wasn't anything written on the bottom of it. This was a must-have because of it's rating on here and even though this was old, this was such a hop bomb that I had to take my time sipping this. Yes, this beer was quite intense but it was worth the effort to enjoy as the label was quite indicative of what the liquid was like!

Hazy, amber, and not topped off with a lot of head, there was lots of debris floating in this but surprisingly, the lacing left behind wasn't that thick at all. Hop oils. tropical fruits, weed, and nectar filled the nose as they could all be found in the taste as well. Lychee, passion fruit, star fruit, jack fruit, and orange blossom filled the palate as the taste was quite complex and rich while being dry at the same time. Hoppy, herbal, and underlying sweet, this had a subtle but long-lasting stickiness that was indicative of this beer's makeup as it was hard to put away; while being hard to resist at the same time.

Plenty of booze here but it was felt more than tasted although I could feel it creeping up on my well before I finished this off. A deep, fresh, dank pine tied everything in together as it was felt from the first sip until well after the last drop went down. If you like your beers to be complex and engrossing at the same time, you've found you're match here. This was a solid brew that deserves it's lofty rating on here even though I wasn't quite gung-ho about it as others on here have been. It's easy to see why this is so loved, as it's a must-have for anyone looking for the best of what a New England IPA has to offer. Just make the time to savor this properly!","Nov 30, 2019"
Crusher,,California,4.48/5,"16 oz can from egrandfield!
Yakima Valley Hops glass

Golden turbid blonde with an orange blush, creamy head of 1 finger receding to a ring, less lace than most Alchy beers but still pleasing to the eye. 

My first reaction to the aroma is, ""Holy Crap!"", that's A LOT of hops. Like walking into a hop yard after a fresh rain. Tons of orange juice-y aromas, with some mango, flower, evergreen, and grapefruit. It's fantastic. 

And the flavor doesn't disappoint, either. It's a nearly perfect juicy New England IPA, but still has that Alchemist palate scraping that can be a little too intense. The finish is just a little ashy but the rest of the beer is pure juice and hop cone. Grapefruit juice, mango, mangosteen, orange juice, pineapple, then fades to pine, grass, dirt, ash in that order. 

Feel is juicy and creamy and acidic, really nice stuff, has a solid alcohol burn which right now is welcoming to me. 

Overall, my favorite Alchemist beer by a mile, I've always enjoyed Heady but felt it was a touch overrated for what it is. Crusher is absolutely new wave Alchemist and I really really like it. Don't miss it.","Sep 12, 2019"

Sosus,,Idaho,4.14/5,"Review 1491

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant. 

The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent. 

The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches. 

The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp. 

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish. 

The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed.","Apr 13, 2021"

Sosus,,Washington,4.39/5,"L: A pale murky yellow, with a slight greenish and warm orange tints. Two fingers of stark white sticky foam with great retention and some splotches and wide bands of lace on the glass. The lacing is really beautiful.

S: Earthy papaya, and greener aromas such as green papaya and underripe pineapple. Both piney and peppery.

T: Still insanely bitter on the palate, but the other flavors are quite soft in contrast. And wow that bitter dryness goes on and on. I do like it though. Most would not pound this back - it's a sipper.

F: Smooth and mostly dry. Medium weight and decent carbonation.

O: I rarely call anything too bitter. This one is pushing limits. Overall I don't think it's my favorite from TG, (that might be Scorpius Morchella) but it is a really nice drink, that I hope to repeat.","Mar 07, 2021"

Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a cloudy golden-orange body with heavy particulate in suspension. I'm glad that I know this is fresh! The head is a standard cap of white. The aroma is bright with pineapple, citrus pith, orange, pine, and sage. The flavor follows. The malt is sweetish and wheaty but otherwise basic. Hop notes include pineapple, pine, earthiness, spiciness (perhaps from alcohol but at just 7.8% that's doubtful), herbs, orange, papaya, and mango. It's got a sild bitterness to it and it finishes quite dry with spiciness, earthiness, and pine swirling as it slowly fades. At this point I've got a clear layer of sediment on the bottom of the glass. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but I definitely don't feel great about it. It's OK I guess. The mouthfeel is full and smooth despite it having just a medium body so that's the trade-off. In the end it's certainly a tour de force that needs to be reckoned with but I don't feel it's as balanced and rounded as it could be. On the other hand, sometimes a little bit of brashness is welcomed. You'll have to try it for yourself and decide.

Sosus,,Washington,3.35/5,"Slight haze on the amber brew with adequate foam in the Piraat tulip. Inviting aroma of fermenting pineapple, orange, and a whiff of compost. Sticky and sweet. Tastes of bitter cucumbers with citrus peel. Endlessly bitter with an aspirin taste. This is a plain overdose of a perfectly good hop for no good reason.

Quite a lovely aroma, but the woody, bitter, metallic, and astringent aftertaste is a little too much for my taste. Purchased for a rather ridiculous price from a West Coast beer boutique. From the 16 oz can dated 12/24/20 on the bottom.","Feb 09, 2021"
Sosus,,Pennsylvania,4.47/5,"Toppling Goliath can do no wrong. Another great offering from them. Pours a light amber with nice lacing and great bright color. Tropical and dank mixture in the aroma.

Pleasant dull tropical fruit aroma.

On tasting, it's one of those beers that you want to drink way faster than you should. Sweet, hoppy, lightly bitter, abv nigh on invisible. Citrus noses ahead of non citrus.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish fruity bitterness, and finally a little warmth confirming the presence of alcohol.

Sosus,,New Jersey,4.47/5,"Packaged 8/20/20. Not even a month old. 

Pours out a clean and clear looking yellow. In the glass its a mildly hazy yellow color. Some haze, but not gravy looking. A finger and a half of soapy, foamy white head. This looks really nice. 

Nose is not very strong. What I get is citrus notes. Tangerine mainly. Very mild tropical notes. But what really takes the lead is the piney, weed like scents. Not strong, but stronger than everything else. 

Taste is a lot of that pine and weed dankness. The initial impact is solid, but not overwhelming. That resinous quality persists throughout, but it is kept under control. The citrus sits underneath. A mild undertone. The flavors are balanced and delicate. There is nothing aggressive about this brew. Mild to medium bitterness, almost no hop burn, no flavor overstaying its welcome. This is such a smooth and casual drinker. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild to medium carbonation. Wow. This mouthfeel suits this brew perfectly. Its just...how can I say it? Light, comfortable, drinkable, smooth. It just fits. It practically drinks it self. I finished this a little more quickly than I thought I would. The drinkability on this one is crazy. 

Overall? I mean...this is not a jooze bomb or an over-the-top hazy. But this takes strides in showing how important balance is in a brew. Using just Mosaic, Toppling Goliath has crafted a wonderful, casual drinker. If I could find this more readily available in my area this would be staple material. It would sit on my shelf next to Green and 90 Minute anytime of the year.","Sep 16, 2020"

It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too.

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,,Illinois,4.76/5,"A beer that lives up to the reputation. I’ll get to the appearance at the end of the review, mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason. Smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out. Taste is more balanced, with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it. Feel is medium bodied, neither oily nor thick-a perfect example of “just right”. Mouth watering, drinks more like a non-barrel aged 9 or 10% abv than a big bold 12. 

My only problem, however, was evident right off the open and pour. I opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off, but I didn’t hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer, because the one I had had little to no carbonation. It has a nice dark hue with some brown edging, but there was no foam and very little lacing. If they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date, this was bottled 9/26/18. Doing a little online research, in October of last year, there was a release by Prairie that some of this beer was infected, so I don’t know if that’s the case here. But if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation, I’d take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there. Because this is phenomenal!

Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,,Oklahoma,3.12/5,"I had the original by the tulsa boys. I thought and still think it’s the best beer I ever had. This new one is a let down.

Then the big let down came into play. The mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth. This is not a barreled apple brandy. If it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first. The actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination. Is this a bad beer? No. Is this the best beer I ever had ? No. I even doubt the 12% abv and would rate lower around 10%. I took no measurements though. It’s just not as rich and balanced as the original, plain and simple. Considering this is my favorite beer ever. Please try again. I will applaud the extra effort.","Feb 22, 2019"

Holy crap this smells unreal. Straight peanut butter chocolate fudge cookies straight out of the oven with extra vanilla extract in them and a touch of coffee. Marshmallow s’mores ice cream galore. Bourbon booziness in the background. Pastry city. 

Taste is liquid Reese’s cups with dark chocolate fudge drizzled over them. Vanilla bourbon on the follow through, roasty coffee char on the finish. Thick rich body.

Popinski - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Peanut Butter And Marshmallow,,New York,4.52/5,"This one pours a pretty dark black, with no head or lacing, really.

This smells like creamy chocolate peanut butter, cake frosting, hazelnut, and simple syrup.

This is rather sweet, but it's not really cloying. The peanut butter flavor is super killer here, like the creaminest and nuttiest peanut butter ever. There's lots of sweet vanilla- it's definitely a bit of a 'nilla bomb. There's basically absolutely no barrel here, which is surprising, and slightly disappointing. 

Nonetheless, this is so creamy, velvety and smooth- it's delightful to drink. There's a lower level of carbonation.

Barrel Aged Bomb!,,Illinois,4.46/5,"Bottled 2016 (I think? It’s hard to read) 
Consumed 4/12/20

I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out!","Apr 12, 2020"
Barrel Aged Bomb!,,Massachusetts,4.04/5,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point.

A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength.

S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms. 

T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish.

M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation. 

O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great.","Apr 05, 2020"
Barrel Aged Bomb!,,North Carolina,4.75/5,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a minuscule tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with no lacing
S: Smells of coffee, a little chili heat, hints of vanilla, oak, and some chocolate.
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee with some vanilla, oak, light chili heat, caramel, and roasted malts. On the swallow there's more chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and some slight lingering heat.
M: This beer has a fairly full and silky body. Carbonation is nearly absent but it works for the beer while the finish is on the drying side from the ABV.
O: Overall this is a fantastic beer. It has some great flavors and complexity which is heightened by the barrel aging. Alcohol is also well hidden as this one This is definitely a beer to be sipped and savored. I'd consider this one to definitely be one of the best examples of the style and definitely one to try if you can get your hands on it.","Oct 14, 2019"
Barrel Aged Bomb!,,North Carolina,4.43/5,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle from the Craft Beer Hop Stop7-24-19 for $12.99. No bottling date visible. Consumed 10/7/19.

Beer poured black and with an aggressive pour a nice tan head materialized before dissipating quickly.

Nose is light roasted malts and an ample amount of coffee, some vanilla, and a faint trace of bourbon.

Taste is very well balanced between roasted malts, chilies, coffee, chocolate, and a kiss of bourbon. Hopping and adjuncts are just to the right degree to offset the huge sweet malt base.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth.

Overall this was a fun splurge. The bourbon and chili help balance the sweetness of the huge malt base very well. IMHO this is a one and done given the ridiculous pricing as there are many choices out there anymore.","Oct 07, 2019"
Barrel Aged Bomb!,,Ohio,4.06/5,"Good but not as good as Bomb. I wish there was more bourbon and the mouthfeel was thicker. Good flavors but a bit muted. Glad I got to try it but at this price point (9 bucks for the bottle), there are better choices.","Jul 16, 2019"

Barrel Aged Bomb!,,Indiana,4.34/5,"Interested and curious to try this again. Because I remember the first time having this (in 2016) noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb! I have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted. And because it's only 11.2%? The regular is 13% and pirate bomb is 15%? What's the difference here? Let's see. Pouring from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. This beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before I even got a picture. The first thing I notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit. Raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell. Very good smell but I'm not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb! So we'll see what the tastes brings. From the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor, while the dark fruit are supporting from behind. As far as the chili peppers, it's about what I expected. You wouldn't even know they're in the beer. I wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well, but I do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering. The mouthfeel is thick and fudge like. It coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation. Overall, this was a very good treat and I'm glad to have another crack at it. But it's pretty much what I remember from the first time. It's very good, but not great. I've had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original. Kinda takes the point away to me, I guess. It's a solid treat nonetheless, but give me a regular Bomb! and I'll be good.","Jan 02, 2018"

Barrel Aged Bomb!,,Michigan,4.68/5,"Smell: Initially I get a good amount of spicy green chillies. a lot of chocolate. Dark Chocolate, milk chocolate. You get some Barrel notes, Sweet vanilla, toasted coconut, smooth whiskey with a hint of oak. Also get some caramel and dark malts that come through as well. 

Taste: This is a lot sweeter and Maltier on the palate. Right upfront I get massive amount of butterscotch, carmel, and chocolate syrup. The sweetness from the chocolate and malt carry through the beer. In the mid palate you get milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, and smooth medium roast coffee, almost like a cold brewed coffee in the way that it's not very roasty and it is extremely smooth. The beer finishes with a hint of green pepper spice, whiskey, toasted coconut, a kiss of oak and more of that Hershey chocolate syrup. As I mentioned the beer is sweeter on the plate which is really nice. The malty butterscotch sweetness lingers on in the after taste as you feel a nice lingering warmth in your chest. The beer also has a ton of chocolate which is awesome.

Feel: Medium bodied. A really nice creaminess, a perfect amount of carbonation, which helps the beer feel a little fuller, which is a good thing because the beer is on the thinner side for a Barrel Aged Stout. Still the carbonation and creaminess makes the beer just glide across your palete, which in turn makes this way easier drinking then it should be.

Overall: An awesome beer that really held up great to the Barrel aging process. The Barrel adds a big sweetness and nice boozy presence. In the end though This is only slightly better then the none Barrel Aged version, I would say there almost equal, which is ok because both the BA and non BA version are top notch world class offerings. Don't worry if you can't get your hands on the BA version, because the regular will do just fine.","Dec 20, 2017"

Barrel Aged Bomb!,,Florida,4.46/5,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Dark brown to black, and opaque. A thin tan head fades fairly quickly atop a low level of visible carbonation.

S: Really nice on the nose. Whiskey and chilis, chocolate and coffee. Sweet malts mixed with vanilla and oak. Notes of drying tobacco and toffee and Bit-o-Honeys. Awfully good.

T: Chocolate, chilis and coffee up front. The whiskey heat comes next, with significant oak and vanilla flavors. Caramel, more vanilla, and cacao nibs. Tobacco and some roasted malts add some bitterness. More chocolate and coffee with mild but definite chili heat in the hang.

M: The body is heavy, though not as thick and glass-staining as Hunahpu. Low carbonation sensation but fine for style. Alcohol presence is actually pretty restrained for style, but it remains warming as it goes down.

O: This was really, really good. The barrel complimented this beer more than I expected. This all really works well. Nice chili flavor without a ton of heat. Definite barrel presence without overwhelming the multiple adjuncts. Excellent.

NOTE: I knocked down my ""Overall"" rating a little. I had a second bottle that I reviewed, forgetting that I had already done so. I didn't care for the second bottle nearly as much, with an estimated BA Rating of 3.95. I decided to enter in the tasting notes from the ""better"" bottle, and left the given scores alone.

Silky black with a minimal bubbly head. 

Aroma of huge spices and hot fudge, with emphasis on nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon, but with extended depth and oak sweetness. Slightly coffee, with coconut and more fudge. 

The beer is like your childhood - but barrel aged. Huge fucking BARREL AGED nutmeg in your face. Cinnamon. It's so Christmas-y, and rich and full. Tons of fudge in the background with hot caramel sauce and peppermint coffee. Fading notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, fudge, and bourbon. This is magic. 

Feel is a bit thin from the barrel but still within thick stout territory. Alcohol heat is evident and welcome, with a slightly slick feel and a hot finish. Good carbonation too. 

Overall,. an absolutely phenomenal, incredible beer that I wish I could find here in Tulsa to take home via package liquor but unfortunately could not. Do not waste your time on mediocre beer. Life is too short. That is the greatest lesson I have learned in 3,000+ beers. If they suck, walk. Prairie does not. Worth the $17, even at the bar. Created a memory burned into my brain.

Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,,Kentucky,4.49/5,"If the emperor gets to wear new clothes then this king of stouts dons its Christmas attire! This time enveloped in bourbon drenched Santa suit, the flavors of the Christmas Bomb! imperial stout are brought to the palate with generous additions of holiday spice and the warmth of the bourbon barrel.

Much like thatch, the Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying a mirror-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, holiday spice, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla, whisky and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with toffee, vanilla, molasses and a general gingerbread flavor before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.

Develops a more earthy character through the middle palate, those fresh flavors are decadent with bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut in its bitterness power. A syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove and vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel, toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.

Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of good 'ole Kentucky bourbon, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a simmering warmth of holiday spice in mulled ale form.","Dec 31, 2019"

Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,,Minnesota,4.61/5,"2018 vintage.

I have to admit - Christmas Bomb is not my favorite of the Bomb series. The spices tend to be a bit overdone, and in such a rich, thick, heavy beer, it exhausts my taste buds rapidly.

Interesting what a bourbon barrel will do to beer though - the spices seem to have been much better balanced when aged. The beer isn't significantly hotter, but the spices aren't so painfully in your face. The nose is tremendous - my favorite aspect of the beer.

M: Medium-full bodied and medium carbonation.

Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,,Indiana,4.26/5,"I'm going to be doing this side by side with a original Christmas Bomb! Pouring both from 12 oz. bottles into pint glasses. This brew pours out a pitch black with coffee like highlights and forms a thin caramel/mocha colored crown. The original has better retention and the barrel aged didn't hold on long before showing nothing. The smell is nutmeg and cinnamon mixing with a warming whiskey and peppers. Some dark fruit notes like raisins are present as well. The taste is a little bit too heavy on the whiskey for my preference but does turn into smoother notes of peppers and vanilla. I get a lot more nutmeg and coffee in the original. The cinnamon is present in both. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side for a barrel aged prairie stout and could use a little bit more bounce for my liking. Overall, this is a solid barrel aged offering from Prairie, which should be expected, but just didn't blow me away. I will just stick with the regular and be perfectly okay with that. I would drink this again, but not go on a hunt and search it out. This is a bit more complex than the original, but once again I will say it, there is beauty in simplicity!!!","Jul 27, 2018"
Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,,Alabama,4.56/5,"Finally decided to open this up. Stamped BA XMAS | 18:57 | BA XMAS.

Viscous black pour, with a dark tan head of bubbly foam that has a decent build up considering the cold temp it was poured. It settles quickly into nothing.

The nose has that Mexican hot chocolate goodness. Roasty coffee, creamy chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and chili peppers. As it warms, the barrel becomes a little more present, as does the predominance of that cinnamon.

Again, the bottle doesn’t specify what ‘spices’ are in this beer but there has to be chili peppers. There is a nice spicy warmth that is present throughout, helped by that barrel aged booziness. Dark Roast on the backend, subtle vanilla, and dark chocolate. The chiles and coffee are predominant in the flavor, but this beer has great balance and while it’d be much better on a snowy day, 105 degree heat in Southern California will have to do. The whiskey flavors really emerge as the beer has time settle on your taste buds. Really nice lingering sweet bourbon flavor.

Nice full bodied stout, creamy and warm. The chiles and whiskey combine for such a nice finish. There is an expected stickiness, and for 13 percent this is so smooth.","Jul 26, 2018"

Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,,Michigan,5/5,"Smell: Big spice notes. Cinnamon is definitely the dominant spice along with a light nutmeg and ginger presence. Really rich milk chocolate, vanilla, coconut. A good amount of pepper and earthy medium roast coffee. With a splash of barrel character. Sweet not really boozy whiskey and toasted oak. Smells a lot like the regular but a bit more amplified. The beer smells wonderful!

Taste: Right upfront your greeted with sweet rich milk chocolate and vanilla notes. That sweetness clears out for a beautiful smooth medium roast earthy coffee and dark chocolate notes in the mid palate. The coffee is really prevalent and complex in the mid palate and changes almost to an espresso like flavor as the beer moves into the finish. Also the spices mostly cinnamon along with a spicy pepper note start to show there teeth as the beer moves into the finish. In the finish you get some barrel character, but not in your face character. You get some toasted oak, coconut and a smooth whiskey presence. The beer never becomes boozy and the heat is generated from the big cinnamon and pepper presence that takes the lead in the finish, just as the heat becomes almost overwhelming a quick flash of sticky carmel and rich milk chocolate comes back through as the beer is touching the last parts of the back of my tongue and adds just enough balance to the spice and heat to make the beer a really unique one of a kind experience as this spicy sweet liquid is going down the back of the throat. The whiskey milk chocolate, carmel, cinnamon and pepper linger in the aftertaste with the cinnamon really adding a drying effect to the tongue and back of the throat.

Feel: The beer has a beautiful full mouthfeel that is verging on that thick chewiness that all great Barrel Aged beers should strive to achieve. The beer finishes dry due to the big cinnamon presence in the finish. The complexity and full mouthfeel make this a beer that deserves to be sipped on, so one can truly enjoy all this wonderful liquid has to offer.

Overall: What a great job on taking an already damn good base beer and making it outstanding with the barrel aging process. Prarie has one of the best Barrel programs in the country. This is definitely world class and is no doubt in that top tier of Barrel Aged beers. By far the best spiced stout I've ever had.","Jan 17, 2018"

A: Beer pours a cola like black color from bottle. Not much head at first pour. The slight head was tan in color. Almost no lacing while drinking. 

S: Pepper and cinnamon at first smell. Smells seemed to change as the beer warmed. I started noticing more barrel and coffee notes as the beer got warmer. 

T: Outstanding varieties here in the beer. First tasted spices and cinnamon. Later on picked up more chocolate sweetness. Many different fllavors melded well together. Nothing over powers and I seemed to notice different flavors almost every drink. 

M: Beer has a full mouthfeel. The many flavors mask the barrel aged kick. Some tingle during swallow. Flavors and feel linger about after swallowing. 

O: The variety and noticeability of all the different flavors stand out on this beer. Would have liked to have seen more carbonation and head on the pour. Overall, an outstanding beer and worth waiting in line for release.","Dec 10, 2017"

Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,California,4.04/5,"2020 20.8 abv

Disappointed with this release. Crazy legs and some notable heat on this one, which is to be expected from a BT variant, especially at this abv. However, it lacks all the nuance I expect from a BT. I can definitely taste the base beer, but not much else. Even the base beer is not as prominent because it shares the stage with the taste of booze. I think I detect a trace of rum and barrel, but it is so insignificant that I could easily just be convincing myself of something that really ain't there. Compared to other BT variants, this ain't it. Compared to other big rum barrel aged stouts, this definitely ain't it. This was my first experience with BT rum barrel aged and rum barrels just so happen to be my favorite medium to age stouts. From the looks of other reviews, this should have been a tasty damn beer. Maybe next year.","Dec 03, 2020"
Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,California,4.52/5,"2014 vintage

Appearance: Very dark brown with medium-sized dark beige head, which dissipated fairly quickly. Noticeable legs on this one. A nice looking BT variant. the head stuck around which is notable for a beer 18.9%.

Smell: Rum and brown sugar aromas are the prominent aromas followed by some raisin aromas. I also pick up faint alcohol aromas which is very nice in light of the high ABV.

Taste: The rum and brown sugar notes from the nose carry over to the taste, along with the raisin notes. I also pick up some moderate vanilla and coffee/roast malts notes. This particular variant is sweet like other Black Tuesday (BT) variants I've had but it dries out quicker than the regular Bourbon bal-aged variant. The beer dries out nicely with a touch of rum sweetness in the finish. I sat on this for 6 years but how little alcohol presence this beer has for it's listed 18.9% is amazing. 

Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a modest level of carbonation appropriate for the style. Very restrained alcohol presence for the listed ABV.

Overall: A very nice BT variant, The complex tasty palate of regular BT with Rum bal-aging rather than Bourbon bal-aging. The subdued alcohol presence is deceptive to the point of being dangerous if someone doesn't respect the 18.9% ABV. One can only hope this is rebrewed.","Aug 08, 2020"
Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,North Carolina,4.75/5,"A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer topped by a finger of dense light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: The nose on this one is a lot of intense rum barrel with a little bit of alcohol. Chocolate, roasted malts and coffee come in at times as well along with the oak from the barrel.
T: Taste is an intense sweetness before the rum barrel comes in strong with that funky rum flavor we all know and love. Really nice chocolate notes followed by some roasted malts and espresso but the sweetness and rum keep coming back. The oak on the barrel is there but it doesn't overpower. On the swallow this beer is more sweet rum barrel with chocolate, roasted malts and coffee coming in at the end with a hint of vanilla.
M: This beer is big and silky on the palate. Carbonation is there but struggles to come through as more than a slight sensation on the tongue while the beer has a drying finish due to the ABV but it isn't bone dry.
O: Holy moly is this beer good. Great flavors and complexity with minimal booze and alcohol. It was apparent on the nose but it doesn't come through in the taste at all. This beer absolutely rocks the house and is a really nice twist on the standard beer. I'd love to see this one come back again.","Jan 19, 2019"

Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,Florida,3.99/5,"Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Brooklyn Brewery tulip glass.

A: Quite black, nearly opaque – though it looks fairly thin during the pour. Forms a thin tan head, and almost no visible carbonation.

S: Rum, spices, wood and vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, and ethanol burn. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from this. Maybe a bigger chocolate aroma.

T: Rum, spices, chocolate and sweet sticky malts. Vanilla and woody dryness with ethanol heat, leather and mild dark fruit. Ethanol and rum spices with mild chocolate in the hang.

M: The body seems a bit thinner than expected. The alcohol burn is significant, but not as much over-the-top heat as you might think given the listed ABV. Still, it's very “rummy”, and some sips just seem like chocolate-flavored rum. Low carbonation sensation.

O: Good, but I'm not sure I like it as well as the regular bourbon version. Very rummy, and sweet. I’ll file this under the long and growing list of beers that I don’t think the rum barrel treatment was the way to go.","Feb 12, 2017"

Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,New Mexico,4.12/5,"Poured into a tulip from the 750. Shared by a generous New Mexico BA. 

Appearance was a thick and viscous and black as one would expect from motor oil or any big Bruery stout. 

The smell was solvent as all hell and clearly suggesting some barrel and booze. Beneath were the pleasant dark chocolate and dark fruit notes one would hope for with the style. 

Flavor was a huge turn in the right direction. Bursting with raisin and fig and enveloped in a rum flavor, this resembled some boozy Caribbean dessert I've had or dreamed of in my mind. I really loved the sticky raisin wine like flavor with the complements of rum. A friend accused me of harboring a soft spot for rum as the husband of a Dominican woman, to which I can only say yes I have a soft spot for Caribbean women. What was the question? 

And as for how this drinks? Come on now. It's a Bruery 19er or something. It's thick as maple syrup and rich as all hell. Hard to complain about the feel and booze wasn't overwhelming the beer. 

Very damn good.","Apr 10, 2016"
Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,Minnesota,4.73/5,"Thanks to CTJman for answering my plea a while back; I’ve been looking forward to this one & since I don’t have to wake up tomorrow (I mean I will eventually, I hope) it’s time. Black-waxed 750ML bottle split with my wife. 

The wax isn’t too bad & the beer pops loudly upon release, foreshadowing lively, but short-lived, visible carbonation, though it keeps audibly crackling for a while. The nose is dominated by rum & sweet corn syrup, & while there are probably subtleties, they aren’t easy to spot under that onslaught. 

Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel Aged is a decadent, rum-soaked, Caribbean, sun-splashed treat. Rum lights up the palate over a base of enough malts to denude multiple acres. Powdered sugar soaked in sugar water & drizzled with brown sugar, rich toffee, syringe of alcohol to the brain stem, light spiciness (from the rum I presume, & the only light thing about this monster), vanilla, high quality maple syrup. Did I mention the alcohol? Or sweetness? Full, thick, oozing. I’m going be enjoying this half-bomber for a long while, & I’d be happy to have had the other half, too. 

I love alcohol, sweetness, & rotting my teeth, so why wouldn’t I love this? I do. This is in the upper echelon of barrel-aged stouts & the best of the variants I’ve had to date. Absolutely stunning.","Mar 24, 2016"

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark dark brown nearly black. Very thin mocha head that faded quickly to leave a light halo.

S - Aromas of chocolate chip cookies, nice decent fudge. Belgian dark chocolate, no booze though. The rum is strangely subtle on the nose. 

T - Taste is similar to the nose , lots of rum up front with a fair amount of barrel. The rum though is almost syrupy. Decent fudge and rich chocolate. Fair amount of almost fusel alcohol. 

M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, alcohol hidden decent enough.

O - Overall this beer was rather underwhelming. The rum didn't bring much to the table, in fact it seems to hinder the beer. Very disappointing.

No real head a touch of fizzy bubbles, thick dark pitch black motor oil with legs that seems to go to Tahiti and back.

Nose big boozy syrupy malt, candy syrup, chocolate syrup, fudgey, little biscuity cookie expensive Belgian chocolate, fluffy nougat, tons of coffee syrup, very little rum, candy fruit, little bitterness, no real booze, rum get more candy molasses fruit thing as it warms.

Taste brings more rum up front, candy syrupy molasses and candied dates, syrupy molasses, big candy malts, dark malts, little roasted, coffee syrup and caramel, back into mild cookie dough and fudgey dark chocolate, little cocoa dust, little vanilla, a bit of a cheap rum or cheap syrup, fluffy nougat too. A fusel alcohol, not super boozy but fusel and bitter flavor. So much candy, yet a dry mildly boozy finish, candy notes, more cookie dough and dark choc, molasses sticky candy, fusel alcohol.

Mouth is thick syrupy fudgey, lots of fusel alcohol hot booze, decent carb.

Overall eh, an ok beer, the barrel didn't round off the fusel alcohol at all and added strange syrupy molasses thing. Pretty much a let down.","Feb 19, 2016"
Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,Kentucky,4.75/5,"Probably best described as a black barley liqueur, the Black Tuesday brand doesn't need much tinkering, trying or adventure. Its a most utopian beer all on its own. But the marriage to rum barrels offers a kiss of even greater succulence and charm. And to think- most folks are simply happy that its not Monday anymore.

Pouring the same abyss-black with an onyx sheen as the standard Tuesday, the stout also looks like an oil slick with a menacing purpose. As a dainty espresso crème mounts, the beer swirls with sticky legging of brandy proportions. Espresso, chocolate, coconut, vinous fruit and spiced rum fill the nose with opulence while a backbone of black-strap molasses, maple and bittersweet chocolate saturate the palate, seemingly of brownie batter in taste and consistency.

The full brunt of flavor is known as the middle palate mounts, saturating each and every tastebud with extreme espresso, molasses, chocolate, walnut and hints of roasty smoke. Port wine, sweet rum, and madeira offer up a savory umami meatiness to balance the sweetness and add salinity. Its spicy finish is mildly tart with red wine yet smoothened with vanilla and heavy cream.

Massively texture, chewy and silky- the lavish texture hinges on cloying, but its milkshake consistency wraps the tongue in its heavy coat and is patient to relax. The beer's extended flavor is indefinite and unyielding- warm with sweet booze, very much a digestive like fine liqueur.","Feb 19, 2016"

BeerAdvocate review #850, working my way to 1,000!

Thanks to yumbeer for sending this one over via trade! 


A: Pours an opaque black, small tan head dissipates very quickly. Leaves essentially no lacing but some alcohol legs. 4.25

S: My god, its decadent. Super sweet and super boozy, both in a good way. Sugary/syrupy sweetness, dark fruits, subtle cocoa. Fairly strong rum notes from the barrel, and some fusel alcohol. 4.5

T: Again, wow. Like the aroma implied its massively sweet with sugar cane, dark fruits, and chocolate. As sweet as it is, its not cloying; balanced by booze and subtle roastiness. Rum characters are noticeable and add a very nice touch. Just flat out fantastic. 4.75

M/D: Full bodied, pretty thick, surprisingly not syrupy, and although the ABV is noticeable its actually remarkable subdued considering it clocks in at 18.9%. 4.75

O: Fantastic beer. I love regular Black Tuesday, and I enjoy this rum BA variant even more. 4.75","Feb 13, 2016"

Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,,Netherlands,4.02/5,"Got this one from Claaaark13 a while ago. Thanks again man! 

From a 750 into a snifter
Bottled on

APPEARANCE: Looks like all the other Black Tuesday offspring. A very transparent, thin, and relatively light brown pour yields a thin, loose, bubbly, off-white head with lousy retention. Head quickly fades to a thin ring, which eventually vanishes as well. Light bistre brown body, clear, with no real carbonation evident. Looks flat by the end and absolutely no lacing at all and it's much too thin and transparent for the style as well. Very disappointing look. 

SMELL: Quite sugary, which is no surprise. Lots of rum, oak, vanilla, toffee, sweet cream and booze. Some nice brown sugar and molasses from the base beer come through as well. Definitely a sugar bomb, but very enticing. 

TASTE: Sweet and alcoholic. Sweet molasses and brown sugar from the base beer show up first, with flavors of oak and sweet rum joining the party up front. Definitely sweet but very flavorful. Lots of alcohol at the swallow with toffee, oak, vanilla, sweet cream, brown sugar and molasses, and a nice dose of sugary rum as well. Desert in a glass. 

PALATE: Same as all the other BT brews but maybe a little less abrasive, which is nice. Otherwise, medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Prickly on the palate, not as smooth as hoped, goes down okay with a big burn at the swallow and finishes very sticky. Lots of heat lingers as well. Could definitely be creamier and smoother, but other beers at this ABV have been worse. 

OVERALL: This was really decadent. Very sweet of course, and definitely boozy for sure, but the aromas and flavors were like a sweet desert lover’s paradise. This one was perhaps less abrasive than a lot of The Bruery’s Black Tuesday variants and vintages as well, which helped the overall experience. I really enjoyed this one and it might be my favorite incarnation of the base beer since the ’09 first came out all those years ago. Thanks again for this one Claaark13. Would love to drink this again at some point.","Jan 11, 2016"

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer

Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple

It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest 

A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

Blanc De Blancs,,Minnesota,4.5/5,"Blend 2 - drank October 25th, 2019. Quite sour, a bit funky, slightly musty with very nice grape notes. Really excellent. This reminds me quite a bit of Jester King sours. Thank you, Buck89!","Feb 24, 2020"
Blanc De Blancs,,Missouri,4.16/5,"Pours foggy golden orange that drops to a murky transparency when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head is near null with only a bit of fizz rising to the top and disappearing - akin to a glass of Champagne. Aroma is dry green grapes, tart green apple and lemon zest in a white wine, champagne-esque display. Light sour twist to it. Flavor profile continues the tart green apple and dry green grape story-line. Interwoven are notes of lemon zest, cellar stone, grapefruit and peach. Finish is lightly sour, with light-bodied, citrus sugary notes lingering long after the finish. Mouth feel is characterized by a moderately soft effervescence that only opens up after the initial sharp, energized effervescence decays. It has a medium, middle of the road, consistency. Overall, very unique. Lightbodied sourness mingles with dry green grapes and tart green apple to form a beer styled after champagne and white wine.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle.","Jan 11, 2020"

Blanc De Blancs,,California,4.05/5,"Acts exactly like champagne. Foams up immediately, recedes quickly, bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass. Crazy musty aromas, with a Moscato-like sweetness. Between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas, the jaw-aching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock. The 10% is front and center with tons of white wine, funk, barrel, and a dry as a bone finish.","Sep 07, 2019"
Blanc De Blancs,,Ohio,3.97/5,"Burnt amber with a fizzy head that dies instantly to an almost still surface but for a light effervescence coming up in the center.

Moderate woody funk that brings both a little blue cheese and walnut underlies super sharply sour grapefruit and white grape that's somewhat vinegary, like a mango balsamic. The crisp medium-light body finishes paper dry with a little floral bitterness coming out on the exhale.

Another overly SOUR Side Project bottle.","Jul 31, 2019"
Blanc De Blancs,,Missouri,4.26/5,"Copper colored, hazy, and with no real head. The aroma is of very forward oak and chardonnel grapes. I'm tasting the chardonnel grapes, oak, and very tart microflora. There's nothing subtle about the aggressiveness of the flavors here. The mouth is bone dry, lightly acidic, and offers moderate carbonation.","Jun 26, 2019"
Blanc De Blancs,,Maryland,4.71/5,"Aroma is complex and very, very intense in aroma. Super funky aroma with breadiness, grape must etc. It's quite spectacular. Taste comes off moderate to high sour scale, high acidity, and a little bit boozy. Sweet as well blended with the sour. Not quite as funky in the taste as in the aroma. Feel is quite interesting as the sweet/sour taste you'd expect a cloying syrupiness in the back of your throat but it finishes very clean. Gets high marks for that.

Overall this is quite the exceptional beer, but I think the high ABV and high acidity and sour lean it a tad too extreme and not subtle complex enough.","May 22, 2019"
Blanc De Blancs,,Kiribati,4.15/5,"Thanks to Harrison8 for this one. Blend 2. 12oz bottle poured into 12oz tulip. Poured a cloudy straw yellow color with a head of tight, white bubbles that were dissipating quickly as the beer poured. In fact, there was no head left even as I finished the pour. Obviously, there was no lacing. But, the sound of the effervescence from the carbonation was amazing. i could hear the beer from arms length.

The aroma was a pleasantly confusing mixture of grains, yeast, funk, some floral notes (hops?), grapes, and maybe some oak? Wutever, there was plenty of goodness going on.

On the tongue, similar scenario: so much going on, it's hard to describe. Every sip gives a different perspective. some very nice tartness.

The body was light and crisp, with a very dry finish.

Drinkability was awesome. i couldn't decide if I wanted sip it, or slam it. If I had two bottles, I woulda done both.

Overall, a great beer. A must try if you get the chance.","Apr 04, 2019"
Blanc De Blancs,,Illinois,4.13/5,"Batch 2 bottle purchased at Side Project The Cellar. 

Deep saturated clear yellow appearance. Foam dissipates very quickly and none is left after as you drink. Big barnyard funk aroma. Some of that is also present in the taste but additionally a good bit of sour grapes and mild lemon. Medium acidity and tartness. Medium mouthfeel.","Dec 16, 2018"

Nic champagne yeast and malt base with succulent sour grape, bright flowers, and dry white wine and oak finish. Goes from dry, to wet, to back to dry, with each switch unlocking new flavors. Smell has more of a musk and yeast center, but very spring like and pleasant. Touch of cumulative acidity and sneaky carbonation.","Nov 05, 2018"

A: Pours a pale orangish with no head or lacing. Decently hazy. 

S: Moderate oak, sweet white wine, light barrel char, vanilla and cardamom, light earth and barnyard. Balanced toward the oak.

T: Leans more towards the white wine and green gooseberries than the nose, with light dry oak barrel and a moderate sourness through a long finish which is cut partially by a dose of sweetness. The palate comes off as a sort of sweet and sour thing.

M: Soft medium-light body with medium-high carbonation. 

O: Really tasty stuff. The sourness is just a touch too high/sharp for my taste, and the sweetness is a bit high, but otherwise great flavors and balance between base and oak.","Oct 21, 2018"

M: Medium-full bodied with low-moderate carbonation

Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,Illinois,4.15/5,"Pours a bright, shiny black color. Thick and completely opaque. One to two finger tan sudsy head dissipates steadily until just a thin layer of foam is left behind on the top of the beer. This beer is remarkably thick when you pour it and that does translate into the mouthfeel. 

Aroma is dominated by notes of roasted malts and coffee. There are some lighter hints of chocolate, vanilla, cream, and peanut butter. 

Taste follows the nose with roasted malts and coffee up front. Lots of cream, vanilla and cocoa are noted with an underlying lighter peanut butter note. They call this a milk stout and it certainly is - lots of creamy notes and firmly in the very sweet camp. Bit of a toasty finish on the back end.

The peanut butter in this one really shines most in the feel - it gives this beer an incredibly smooth, creamy feel to it. Medium carbonation. 

Overall a really tasty stout from Tree House.","Sep 24, 2020"
Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,New York,4.31/5,"A very good stout! A little viscous and boozy for my taste, but has lots of depth of flavor and is an enjoyable sipper. There's some peanut butter flavor in there, but it's not too heavy. This is more chocolate-forward, with only moderate notes of coffee. I would say this is middle of the road in terms of Tree House stouts, but still very good overall.","May 15, 2020"
Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,Illinois,4/5,"16oz can, dated 12.04.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep jet black, thick and viscous with a nice khaki head, modest retention and little lacing. The aroma is pleasant, plenty of rich dark and milk chocolate, fusel alcohol, a bit of roasted grain, coffee and sweet cream. The flavors are good, milk and dark chocolates, lightly roasted coffee, toasted grain, sweet cream, mild salty peanut butter that grows as it warms with lingering booze and vanilla. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy medium heavy body, thick and smooth with a warm finish.

Verdict: A nice milk stout from Tree House. Perhaps lacking a bit in the peanut butter front but it's a nice adjunct forward ""pastry"" stout. Balance is nice and it's very easy to drink despite the higher ABV.","Jan 05, 2020"
Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,Massachusetts,4.48/5,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
12/04/19
Served in a tulip

Viscous, pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a tight, creamy, cappuccino colored crown that fell to a clingy collar. A thick, drippy ring of lacing stuck along the glass. On subsequent sips, the lacing broke apart into a spotty curtain.

The aroma was solid. Mocha notes dominated. Nice mix of creamed and sugared coffee and medium roast espresso. Big, rich, dark malt notes were also apparent. Touch of char. Some vanilla came through as well. Moderately sweet.

The flavor profile was similar to the nose but a bit more punchy. Big roasted malt presence on the front end. Some caramel malts as well. Nice amount of sweetness. Mocha notes kicked in mid palate. Smooth, medium roast espresso and semi-sweet chocolate came to mind. Vanilla and sweet cream were also apparent. More bitter roast and espresso on the back end and the finish. Hint of boozy warmth after the swallow.

Super creamy, fluffy, smooth mouthfeel. Fuller bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, fairly aggressive effervescence that frothed up beautifully on the palate. After a few sips, the sugars in the beer left a sticky film on my lips.

Miles To Go Before I Sleep is an impressive milk stout that reminds me of many others in this Tree House series. That said, the peanut butter was completely undetectable. With a bigger peanut butter presence, this could be spectacular.","Dec 31, 2019"
Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,North Carolina,4.1/5,"Appearance: Pours the color of espresso with a one finger mocha head that fades into a bubbly pancake; spotty lacing

Smell: Chocolate and a vague peanut butter character, more like a Reese's than a jar of Skippy; vanilla tones, too

Taste: Sweet chocolate and marshmallow flavors forward with the vague peanut butter aspect emerging; the finish has an odd phenolic taste

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation

Overall: My third milk stout in a row from Tree House and I guess these are just not to my taste; I think they do a great job with their IPAs but I don't think these milk stouts quite stack up to the ratings they accrue - just my taste buds, I guess

Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,California,4.59/5,"Miles to Go pours an inky black, somewhat viscous look with a nicely formed, thin, dark tan head that fades.

The taste is sweet, smooth and decadent over the palette with a rich chocolate, a roasted coffee that infuses a slight bitterness but finishes sweet with peanut butter","Dec 18, 2019"
Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,New York,4.52/5,"Pours as black as ink with a mocha colored creamy 1 finger thick head that faded vert slowly and excellent lacing coating the sides. Outstanding looking for a milk stout.

The nose was milder than expected, with nice char, roasted malts, cocoa powder, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate and caramel or molasses, but the peanut aspect was minimal and there were only hints of bakers chocolate and any additional smoked malt aromas. It was a very complex and nice smelling beer, it just didn’t jump out of the snifter even as it warmed up.

This brew shifts gears with the flavor, as the peanut butter, dark chocolate, bitter black coffee and a candy sweetness like a Heath Bar kick in. There’s still plenty of charred malts, bakers chocolate, toffee, cocoa powder, coffee grinds, a hint of piney bitterness along with some mild vanilla and peat moss. There’s a sweetness from all the chocolate which mixes with the lactose that comes off like a chocolate shake, and this stout hides the ABV masterfully while remaining very tasty, complex and somehow balanced. Another great milk stout from Tree House, I love how the use of peanut butter and coffee stand out in the overall taste.","Dec 13, 2019"

Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,Ohio,3.99/5,"I was really looking forward to this, but, just like it's label, it's really just a slight variation on all of Tree House's bottled milk stouts.

Miles To Go Before I Sleep,,New Hampshire,4.48/5,"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Pours a pure jet black color with a finger of creamy mocha head. The head leaves a crown of frothy lacing before settling into a thick blanket of foam. Darker than Alice Cooper's motor oil.

The aroma brings notes of dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, dark roast malts, and coffee. There's a faint hint of caramel hiding in the back along with some vanilla cream and graham crackers. Kind of like a s'more that some kid snuck a peanut into.

The flavor, like Wilfred Brimley, is all about that dark, chocolate fudge. The peanut butter is subtly present before a wave of coffee and vanilla. There's a touch of caramel, toasted malts, and marshmallow on the finish. As the beer warms, some dark fruit notes come out from hiding. 

The feel is full bodied with soft carbonation. Thick, chewy, and creamy, just like your mom's nickname in High School.

Overall, another fantastic Tree House milk stout. The peanut butter is disappointingly subtle, but the flavors come together well without ever being entirely cloying. Only a little cloying. I'm fat so this is acceptable.","Jul 09, 2019"

S:
Cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate, roast peanuts, faint cherry sweetness, bark, coffee. (4.25)

T:
Closely follows the smell. Thick milk chocolate, coffee and peanut butter flavors, some toasty malts, but not a touch of anything verging on roasty or harsh. (4.5)

M:
Smooth, sticky, soft, excellently hidden alcohol, thick and velvety. (4.25)

O:
A pastry stout if there ever was, but pretty damn tasty regardless.
It pours lovely with a beautiful head on some used motor oil. The aroma has a whiff of umami (I'm guessing from the PB) but it is soon overwhelmed by sweet mocha and boiled peanuts. The flavor follows with more of a sweetned peanut butter-milk chocolate thing going on. This is my favorite of any type of candy, so I suppose it isn't weird that I really like it. However, I was definitely not expecting it to be as good as it is. Still more beer-like than I was worried a beer like this would be, but that is certainly not to say it isn't sweet as could be.

Cloudy, apricot orange colored body. No real lasting head. No lacing.
Aroma of apricot, oak, and rich funk of expresses horse blanket, leather, and hay.
Taste is initially quite woody and herb bud like, and then the sweet/sour apricot comes in. Notes of lemon wash through, along with the dry oak. Late is white wine. The funk is very much of grass and hay. After taste does not last very long, but the essence of apricot lingers.
Tart and drying mouth feel. The teeth are scraped clean with each sip. Quiet carbonation.
The apricot expresses so naturally here, and is the longest lasting flavor note. The herb, oak, funk, and lemon are worthy subordinates.","Aug 04, 2023"

Aurelian Lure,,Kentucky,4.26/5,"Brewed with apricots, spontaneously fermented and allowed to ripen to full sour ale maturity, you'd think that this time honored way of beer making is rooted in the belly of Brussels. But nope, it's Austin Texas.

Aurelian Lure is the lambic-like brainchild of Jester King, pouring with a pale and deep lemon yellow with a light golden center. As the yeasty ale rises with a dainty champagne froth, the jaw-tightening scent of citrus, vinous and stone fruit carry the piquant tang of cider, dusty funk and extended oak aged white wine. As a scantly sweet taste briefly visit the tongue, early impressions of wafers, honey and sourdough offer a slim malt impact.

A quick wash of acidity across the middle palate shows a quick erase of anything malty and an ushering in of sour apricot that stand proud above the other fruity complements of weathered lemon, grapefruit, lime and yuzu. Dried pineapple, peach and white grape all continue to grow from the natural fermentae of the sour ale and play into a strikingly sour late palate of off-vinegar, mature and peppery acids that pang away on the sides of the tongue.

Light, crisp, succinct and highly refreshing, the session is sweat inducing and tooth achingly sour to satisfy the taste for unblended lambic in the deep south. As an afterglow of weathered woods, wine rot and an overall mossy type of earthiness come in brief waves, the aftertaste is otherwise short and concisely winey.","May 16, 2023"
Aurelian Lure,,Illinois,3.94/5,"Murky darker yellow body with a white cap. Smell blasts you with sour apricot backed by complex oak, orange and farmhouse yeast. Taste is a cover up of the scandal. The scandal you ask? The apricot is wickedly acidic and pretty sour too, this is then covered up by farmhouse yeast, light barrel funk, lemon, and oak, but for that moment when the scandal was alone on the palate it was rough. Very bright and sour, funk is not impactful here, oak is brightly so, acidity builds as the secret wants to get out. I love JK but this is the #15 wild ale in the world? Nah, I wouldn't have this again","Apr 11, 2023"
Aurelian Lure,,New York,4.46/5,"Pours a hazy golden color with a thin head that dissipates immediately. The aroma is immediately noticeable, with a strong scent of apricots and a subtle hint of oak. Upon tasting, the apricot flavor dominates, with a tartness that is balanced by a slight sweetness. The oak barrel aging adds a layer of complexity, imparting a mild vanilla flavor that complements the fruitiness of the apricots. The beer finishes with a refreshing tartness that lingers on the tongue, leaving a dry finish.
One of the standout features of Aurelian Lure is its balance. Despite being a sour ale, the tartness is not overwhelming, and is instead complemented by the sweetness of the apricots and the subtle oak notes. This makes for a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a flavor profile that is likely to appeal to both seasoned sour beer enthusiasts and those new to the style.
Another noteworthy aspect of Aurelian Lure is its mouthfeel. The beer is medium-bodied with a light carbonation, which adds to the refreshing quality of the beer. The combination of tartness and effervescence make this a perfect summer beer, though it's enjoyable year-round.
Overall, Jester King Brewery's Aurelian Lure is a fantastic sour ale that showcases the brewery's expertise in wild yeast and spontaneous fermentation. It's a beer that is both complex and approachable, with a balanced flavor profile and a refreshing mouthfeel. While it may be difficult to find due to its limited availability, it's certainly worth seeking out for any beer enthusiast looking to try something truly special.","Mar 26, 2023"

Refined barnyard aroma with hints of hay, lemon and apricot fruit roll-ups.

Delightful taste of super-juicy dried apricot layered over a slightly sour, slightly funky barnyard-and-lemon base. There’s maybe a little white wine. Maybe a little oak. The tartness and acidity comes in on the backend, and is somewhat lighter than I expected. Really superb.

Aurelian Lure,,Colorado,4.52/5,"one of the jester king beers that i have been unable to track down until now, highly acclaimed and on my list forever, stoked to finally have sourced it. its definitely one of the best apricot wild beers in the game, so intense and so natural at the same time, in a lot of ways reminds me of when i tried cascade apricot for the first time, and just realized that there was no more true expression of apricots in beer than that, this is the same, but much less sour, and with the classic jester king funky yeast mix that makes their beers so distinctive all the time. a pulpy orange hazy look to this one, under a short but lasting white head. the nose is incredible, the best feature of this for me and where i really appreciate the apricots most, fuzzy and real, fleshy and juicy and sweet and ripe, their absolute essence. some higher level bacterial acidity evident here too, but all in service of the fruit. nice oak to the flavor, gives it a richness, and a light wine and vanilla thing in the flavor, beautiful with the pale wheat malt and the sugars in the fruit, its funky and sour and also kind of desserty, a little more left at the end of this one than in a lot of their beers, especially these small bottle fruited releases, and i love how long it lingers. more sour than others too, especially at temperature, but it all works so well together. epic expression of apricots in a really amazingly funky and mature wild beer, up there with the best of jester king, and certainly worth all the hype!

edit: i had the insane opportunity to get to drink the original three blends of this all side by side, blend 1 from 2013, blend 2 from 2014, and blend 3 from 2015, courtesy of some friends with deep cellars and generous hearts. pretty increidble how different they all are now, as much as nine years old here in 2022, but all incredibly well preserved and evolved. i was surprised that the oldest was not the most sour, i was surprised all had some amount of residual fruit sugar or pectin remaining after all this time, and i was impressed with how much apricot is still driving them all. the oldest was my favorite, a touch of flattering oxidation, a bit of a lambic nose, tangy and lemony and real complex, white wine to it even. the middle one was most sour, but also seemed to have the most fruit on it, more jammy and enriched than raw and fleshy, probably the most flavorful of them, the newest, which is still ancient by any standard, was most subtle, almost more a blonde ale at its core, some lighter funk and saison type notes, way less bracing acidity, floral and delicate along with the natural apricot. they all had nice carbonation, varying degrees of body and sediment though, and all were a joy to drink. i think everyone in our group had a different favorite, none better than another, and more than anything i am thankful to have had this experience with close friends. not sure how many of these old ones are around anymore, so this felt rare and special, unrepeatable. a glorious beer at any age!","Oct 22, 2018"
Aurelian Lure,,Minnesota,4.5/5,"Blend 4.

I'm continually amazed by how much fruit falls off of sours when aged for some time. I recently enjoyed a Fen Tao and the peach notes were tremendous. Since then, I've drank a Nocturn Chrysalis and an Aurelian Lure - neither have had a comparable presence of fruit, after two years of aging. I'm surprised, for some reason. All beers age differently, but it seems consistent that fruit notes fall off a bit.

Aurelian Lure thus doesn't have much apricot presence left. It's dominated now by sour, tart barrel notes. It's also very acidic. Damn sour, damn tart, and very good - but my acidic reflux was unpleasant after this beer. Be prepared accordingly.","Sep 17, 2018"
Aurelian Lure,,Texas,4.79/5,One of my all time favorites from JK. I have had each batch and while the most recent batch was not as good as ones in the past it is still one of the best sours they make.,"Mar 28, 2018"
Aurelian Lure,,California,4.09/5,"Very nice apricot sour. Pours a golden color with subtle apricot notes. Tart on the tongue, but dry and subtle apricot notes become subtle apricot flavor on the palate. Great brew that I hope to have again","Dec 12, 2017"
Aurelian Lure,,Texas,4.54/5,"I had this at the release on tap, along side Fen Tao, and later in the bottle. I have to say, on tap was better which is like saying the sky is blue. In my opinion, apricot is one of the best fruits to go with sour beers and this is definitely one of the better sours JK makes. Deep apricot flavor, medium sourness, all deliciousness.","Dec 04, 2017"
Aurelian Lure,,Virginia,4.15/5,"2017 vintage (blend 5).

A: Pours a very light straw color with a thin ring of very fine, bright white head. Nicely effervescent. Good retention for the minimal head that’s there. Decent good clarity.

S: Hay, honey, apricot, light barnyard funk. Delicate.

T: A bracing rush of moderate apricot, honey, grainy wheat, grass, and light mineraliness which imparts an interesting dimension. The moderate tartness fades fairly quickly on the finish which saves this from being too sour and helps quaffability. 

M: Medium body and medium-high carbonation. Very mild creaminess. 

O: Tasty, refreshing sour beer without a lot of complexity or depth. It’s hard to say that additional time would help: presumably, any additional development of the brett would be offset by fading of the fruit.","Nov 19, 2017"

Aurelian Lure,,Germany,4.34/5,"Had this alongside an O'so Arbre Qui Donne (which, just as personal preference, I liked slightly better). Hazy orange-yellow color with very little head. Aroma was very funky, with the apricot complementing nicely. The taste was tart and crisp, with the best way I can describe it as 'funky fresh.' The apricots were there, but the funky and tart, slightly puckering mouthfeel that finished not as dry as expected are what make the beer special.","May 08, 2016"
Juicy,,Massachusetts,4.41/5,"L -- Surprisingly amber-brown body with two fingers of white head produced with moderate pour. Some retention and good lacing. 
S -- Definitely dry hopped! Some nice tropical notes along with a somewhat unpleasant medicinal note, almost like Pepto bismol. Also getting oak, mixed berry, and subtle barnyard funk. I like it more as it warms 
T -- The name is pretty spot on here: this is surprisingly candy-like. Not overly tart, but there is some distinct lemon peel character. Great balance between hoppy and funky. 
F -- Crisp, effervescent, eminently drinkable
O -- Definitely my favorite of the dry-hopped HF saisons

Juicy,,Connecticut,4.47/5,"Bottled on February 14, 2020. Pours a vibrant golden color with a finger of medium density white head that receded to a thin ring. Aroma is excellent. A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat. 

On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity. 

Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine.","Jul 04, 2022"
Juicy,,New York,4.38/5,New Zealand inspired beer - aged in wine barrels for 8 months and is fruity and a darker color. Tasted of wine and some sharpness as well in this beer.,"Jul 07, 2021"
Juicy,,Maine,4.61/5,"Alan, thank you so much for this one. 

2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles.

Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out...

Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony.","Jan 22, 2021"

Aroma: Chardonnay, perfume, floral, very pungent aroma.

Taste: ginger ale, white grape, ester, ash

Very excellent and unique. Changes as you sip. Each attribute seems to add to the whole in unexpected ways. Kind of like a wine spritzer.

Juicy,,New Hampshire,4.35/5,"375ml undated bottle from the most recent release.

Pours hazy copper with a half inch head of white with a vigorous pour. Minimal retention or lacing. Surprisingly low carbonation for the style. Light notes of cider vinegar, grape must, wine barrel, and wet hay in the nose. Light bodied with a slickish, thinnish mouthfeel. Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins.

Nice beer but proper carbonation for the style would really help the aromatics and mouthfeel. Not really getting a ""juicy"" impression either.","Oct 14, 2020"
Juicy,,New York,4.56/5,"Poured from a bottle (06Jun2019) into a Belgian glass

L: pours a perfectly clear gold/amber with a moderate white head that fades after a couple minutes. Leaves a great ring of foam around the edge with some moderate lacing

S: lives to its name with the first whiff, really gorgeous and deep tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Followed behind by a mild tart/barnyard funk and great depth from the wine barrel aging. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, some apricot, orange, pleasant acidity

T: follows the nose well, fruit nose comes through but takes a backseat to the base ale. Slightly funky, nicely tart farmhouse flavor with some notable wine barrel structure and depth. Fruit there from the nose, increasing as it’s warmed. Again grapefruit and pineapple, more of that orange as well as apricot. Medium long finish

F: light+/medium- body, medium/medium+ carbonation, slightly drying, moderate acidity

O: a delicious farmhouse ale (no surprise there) with a really great and differentiated nose. Up against stiff competition with the rest of the HF line-up, manages to differentiate itself well","Sep 24, 2020"

I just wanted to try this when I was looking at potential beers and am super happy I did. I really like sours and while this isn’t a sour the Juicy was, for me, close. But this didn’t overwhelm me with tart at all. Just a great blend and very easy going down. I know it’s not a sour but if it was it would be my favorite of all that I have had. Pours a light color, slight head, not much lacing, lingered nicely in my mouth and I could smell it just when I opened it before I poured it. Wonderful beer.

Beautiful aromas of white wine, apple cider vinegar, papaya, honeydew melon, and orange blossom.

Taste: On the first sip, I pick up some tart funk, some straw, some wine barrel. At the very end of the sip, there is a really subtle, slight bitter finish. It is really refreshing and enjoyable.

Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,,Ohio,4.62/5,"Glossy black with a thin dark tan head settling to a persistent ring.

The first sip comes with two competing forces of marshmallow and spicy barrel. The barrel almost has a cinnamon hint to it at first, but not quite. Then creamy strawberry glides in, and is just present enough to help develop that distinct Neapolitan flavor. It's fresh, seedy and mildly fruity, while the base stout is chocolatey.

The medium-light body has a crackly carbonation and finishes semi-dry. A mild but complex and mature barrel heat brings peppery char and caramel. As it warms, licorice, date, nougat and fudge massage the palate further into a pastry coma.

Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,,Oregon,4.36/5,"500ml bottle, gold wax. From the 2018 release. Served in a snifter glass at home. Pours a dark black body, opaque with a one finger offwhite head. Short retention. Not much lacing. Smell is rich strawberry sweetness, vanilla ice cream, fair bit of whiskey heat. Delicious, approaching Scooop territory. Could use a little more chocolate fudge, but there is a fair bit already. Flavour is less of the strawberry and vanilla, and a bit of the chocolate and a fair bit more whiskey heat than the others. Disappointing, but still a very good stout. Fair bit of heat, oak, touch of astringent char. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, appropriately carbonated, heat on the finish that cuts through the overall adjunct fest. Overall- smell is close to achieving what we all wanted from this beer, but the taste isn't anywhere near this. The adjuncts are overpowered by the whiskey on the palate.

Henna: Barrel-Aged Double Rainbow,,Oregon,4.39/5,"I'm gonna be debbie downer here. I was at the Henna Batch 1 release. Landed several bottles. Still have 2 left. I consider them treasures to be opened on only the most special occassions. That beer was simply mind blowing. It's pillowy soft mouthfeel and perfectly blended flavors could easily fool people into believing it was barrel aged. So when the real BA batch was announced, I lost my shit. Couldn't wait for the beautiful flavors to touch my lips again. Maybe I set my sights too high, but I really expected something on par with a Derivation. While BA Double Rainbow is still a great beer, sadly, it doesn't measure up to where I think it should be. I didn't get much barrel from any of the 3 variants. In fact, I'll say you could open a batch 1 and a BA Double Rainbow in a blind side by side, and find it difficult to identify which one had the barrel treatment. That is probably more of a positive comment about B1 than it is negative about BA. I will do that side by side someday. But now maybe more than ever, the occassion will have to be super special.

Opaque, seal brown liquid with a low dun collar. Very fine lacing; fast running legs; poor retention. 

Bourbon, molasses, winter spices, baker's chocolate, fresh dates, and roast malt in the nose. 

Flavor follows the nose but with significantly more intensity and complexity. Rye and hops blend together with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Long, even, medium-dry finish with hints of loam and char. Faint tobacco, vanilla, and coconut emerge as the ale warms. 

Medium bodied, faintly oily, with low but sufficient carbonation. 

Bourbon forward with several layers of flavor - one of the better tasting examples of the style.","May 28, 2022"

Darkstar November,,Missouri,4.3/5,"Pours pitch black with a finger of tan foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, and caramely malts. It's accentuated by chocolate, vanilla bean, and some mild char, adding sweetness and bitterness, respectively. Big and bold on the nose. Flavor profile leads with more sweetness - vanilla bean, molasses, caramel, and chocolate. Roasty and toasty malts lay underneath, keeping the beer from listing into sugary, and doing their darndest at that. A touch of barrel char at the end insures balance. Mouth feel is thick with a consistent, creamy texture. That creaminess keeps it easy to drink despite the alcohol content or the weight of each sip.

On the nose there is roasted malt, char, tobacco smoke, toffee, and a strong scent of bourbon. The taste is considerably sweeter than the smell would indicate. It opens with fudgy chocolate, vanilla, and molasses with hints of dark fruit in the background. The Buffalo Trace bourbon is strong and warming but the overall flavor has a soft quality. Its mouth feel is plush and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and I can really feel the 14.09% ABV. Overall, Darkstar November is a huge Russian Imperial Stout with loads of flavor.

Pours a jet black. Caramel head dissipates completely. Nose is of bourbon layered with vanilla, molasses, and spice from the rye. Marshmallow starts to come through as it warms. Taste starts off sweet from the rye and finishes dry due to the rye. The palate is left with dark chocolate and vanilla from the barrel.

500 ml

Appearance: Black with a medium sized thick foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. The head stayed thick for a while and subsided very slowly. An extremely good looking stout for my tastes.

Smell: Moderate Bourbon aromas, moderate brown sugar aromas, and mild roast malts aromas. 

Taste: Prominent Bourbon notes, roast malts, moderate brown sugar, some black pepper spiciness from the rye, and drying tannic oak notes. The finish is fairly dry with the rye spiciness, roast malts, and tannic oak notes lingering. The alcohol is nicely hidden for the listed 14.76% ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. Pretty nice mouthfeel to this beer.

Overall: A good bal-aged Imperial Stout. The rye used in the brewing nicely counters the molasses so that while the beer starts off fairly sweet it dries up nicely in the finish.","Nov 28, 2020"
Darkstar November,,Illinois,4.5/5,"Darkstar November comes all the way from California. This is the 2019 release so it was aged about a year. It is a unique BA stout because it has rye in the mash but aged in Bourbon barrels. Molasses is also added so the result is the spice of rye, the depth of molasses, and the sweetness of bourbon. It all blends together in a thick, syrupy body. Great job by Bottle Logic.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Washington,3.88/5,"2023-07-03
375ml bottle served in a little snulip. Vintage 2022. Got it from @ozzylizard in NBS BIF #17.

Pours black with no head, looks still. Smell is bourbon and vanilla, burnt toffee and near-burnt nuts, sweet molasses, hint of something like cinnamon or nutmeg.

Taste is (for me) dominated by cinnamon. Nuts are still there, and something comes across as milk chocolate. Molasses sweetness. I was feeling a little bit of spice on my lips and thinking it was a bit odd for cinnamon to have that much power but not be totally overwhelming for me, and then I read on the label that it contains habaneros, and that's clearly evident now that I saw it. As it's warming up, the cinnamon is becoming even more powerful.

Mouthfeel is nicely thick and chewy. Overall...it appears to be a pretty good stout with a nice level of pepper, but too much cinnamon for me.","Jul 03, 2023"

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Pennsylvania,4.3/5,"Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro from Jackie O’s, 12.7 oz bottle. Received from brewery 05/04/23. Reviewed 10/04/23 (Review 3070). Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Printed on the label “2022”. Stored at 34 degrees at home. Served at 54.6 degrees F in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. The final temperature was 59.0 degrees F. 
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Ruby Brown (SRM 24), almost opaque.
Body – Deep Brown (SRM 30), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear lite, shows a translucent olive at the top edge and ruby at the bottom.
Head – None. While pouring, a five mm crescent of large bubbles appears on about a third of the circumference but quickly evaporates.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 4.25 – Bourbon and barrel are the predominant aromas, no malt, no yeast, no hops, no chocolate. Oddly, no habaneros. No ethanol (13.7 % ABV as marked on the label) aroma. 
Flavor – 4.5 – The habaneros set up a nice oral burn, not too hot and lacking any vegetal flavor. Cinnamon rides in on the aftertaste. Initially no hops, malt, or yeast; light chocolate and ghostly vanilla. Slight gastric warming, but that could be from capsaicin as well as ethanol. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4 – Medium; creamy; soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Lacking both head and lacing, the appearance loses a few points. Both the flavor and aroma are quite good, with distinct hits of habaneros, cinnamon, cocoa, and even detectable vanilla, all supported by the bourbon and barrel. Very good and well worth grabbing if you run across a bottle or six. Extra points for having a lizard on the label.","Apr 10, 2023"
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Ohio,4.4/5,"Poured from a 12.7 ounce bottle, the body is a dark cola brown. Small initial head that quickly dissipated and no lacing of consequence.

Aroma is a complex mix of bourbon, cinnamon, vanilla, and chile. The habanero aroma is muted but present.

Taste follows nose though the barrel is a tad sweeter than the nose. You'll need to be patient to pick up the notes of walnut and oak rising from the stout upon which this beer was made (Oil of Aphrodite). The habanero is felt in the swallow, but it's a light heat. In fairness, I love habs and you might perceive more heat. The cinnamon and cacao nibs balance the pepper and the barrel holds everything together in an unlikely tasty stout. A bit more malty char would be welcome, but that's a personal preference and not a complaint.

Mouthfeel is good but not great. I'd love a bit more body in this stout. More carbonation would be welcome.

Overall an outstanding stout that I interestingly found a bit better when colder than I usually drink stouts. The mix seemed more flavorful when first poured.","Apr 07, 2023"

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Germany,4.47/5,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head that quickly recedes. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and distinct chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as some cinnamon and hints of licorice and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt, strong milk chocolate and vanilla, lighter cinnamon and chili heat, as well as hints of dark fruit, with accents of raisin and fig, licorice, leather and bourbon-infused oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a pleasant chili heat lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste. Overall, this makes for a very rich mexican chocolate stout with an excellent balance of sweet and spicy notes and a great bourbon character, as well as full body and mouthfeel.","Apr 03, 2022"

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Connecticut,4.26/5,"Modest head production and retention, but it's not completely still.

Wonderful aroma. Bourbon isn't as prominent as other Jackie O's BBA stouts. Smooth and semi-sweet, with vegetal pepper notes along chocolate and vanilla.

Really nice melange of flavors on the palate. Peppers are very restrained, noticeable for my palate only from very large sips - but I get very little pepper in chili beers normally unless it's strong and prominent. Chocolate is rich and smooth; the vanilla is complementary; I don't get any cinnamon; the bourbon, as with the nose, is restrained but wonderfully complementary. Overall flavor is a big, semi-sweet imperial stout, arguably more of a dessert stout than a chili stout - quite reminiscent of the last few years of Mexican Cake.

Mouthfeel is adequately full and lively; I would prefer both more thickness and more activity, but it's a very drinkable beer.","Jan 09, 2022"
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Massachusetts,4.21/5,"Pours inky black with minimal head. Aroma of roasted almonds, chocolate syrup on the nose. Some vanilla and oak as well.

It's lean and doesn't have the heft of the some of the thiccer bois you hear a lot about these days. The heat from the habañero burn is unignorable on this hot summer day and the idea that it's always stout season seems incomprehensible at the moment. This is a nice stout though and it's always cool to get a top 250 beer in distro.","Aug 25, 2021"
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Ohio,4.79/5,"12 oz bottle, poured into a goblet at 40 degrees F and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly.

S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent.

T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste.

F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Massachusetts,4.29/5,"A- 375ml bottle pours into a tulip glass with a motor oil black body. The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness.

S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here.

T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes.

MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers.

Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest.","Dec 31, 2020"

Had been eyeing this one for a long time. Back to when I missed out on it at one of the Firestone Invitationals. Had seen this one at Bine & Vine for a long time and final pulled the trigger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online description read, “Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro is a dynamic beer brimming with layers of complexity and character. An imperial stout brewed with walnuts, aged in bourbon barrels for a year, and conditioned on vanilla beans, cacao nibs, habaneros, and cinnamon sticks. All spices are added after the barrel aging, right before packaging, to create a vibrant experience.” That’s right up my alley.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Could not see any bubbles coming up from the sides of the glass, but could see it coming up from the middle as the top had almost a perfect swirling circle. Excellent lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Lots of flavors in the nose. In order got cinnamon, vanilla, milk chocolate, walnuts, cocoa, chocolate syrup, cookie dough, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted oak, toasted coconut, molasses, licorice, leather, date, fig and raisin. A little different out of the bottle with maybe the addition of maple syrup. Habaneros are mentioned, but I wasn’t getting any of it on the nose. (Smell - 4.75) 

Taste was almost as good. Damn this is amazing. And there are the habaneros. In order got cinnamon, habaneros, milk chocolate, vanilla, cocoa, chocolate syrup, walnuts, cookie dough, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toasted coconut, leathery oak and dates. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, spicy finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Lived up to my hype. So damn good. I still wouldn’t say worth the price, but I am cheap. Almost perfect. (Overall - 4.75)

The aroma is strong with bourbon first, then vanilla, cacao and spice. The taste is semisweet caramel and chocolate malts with big bourbon easing into nice pepper flavor and heat with the vanilla, cinnamon & cacao on the finish. Minimal bitterness as the spicy heat and drying barrel balance the big malt bill perfectly. The mouthfeel is full to medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a dry finish.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,,Connecticut,4.3/5,"2019 Vintage

Pours an inky black body with faint reddish/brown edges topped with ⅓ of a finger of dark khaki foam barely having the chance to form before transitioning to a sizable, soapy collar; the occasional strand of tightly composed lacing holds tenuously to the glass.

Aromas are strong with notes of brown sugar, oatmeal raisin cookie, milk chocolate, and walnuts upfront, with a firm dried chile powder middle; a backing of well-attenuated mild earthy pepper courses throughout, while touches of vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, caramel, and bourbon-soaked oak quietly come into their own. Decadent but not overbearing, and approachably complex.

Taste profile opens with heavy doses of chocolate fudge, milk chocolate cacao, vanilla and smooth, very slightly smoky bourbon-tinged caramel and toffee; peppery spice builds to a very mild underlying herbal heat, lasting through a nutty, chocolatey swallow.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body with low carbonation; a building peppery heat is tingly and spread along the palate, while the back end becomes slightly sticky/slick into the finish, but dries steadily through the swallow; minimal-no alcohol presence.

An impressive, peppery stout which shows surprising balance between its punchier notes; in spite of the barrel-aged component, it is not bourbon-forward, yet the barrel is spectacularly integrated into every seam of the beer and doing well to temper the heat. The resulting disparate elements thus all find their place within the profile effortlessly, and leave this drinker, normally opposed to spice in his stout, a willing convert (at least in this case).","Nov 26, 2019"

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Canada (QC),4.23/5,Bottle: Poured a blonde color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and light lacing. Aroma of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and light vinous notes. Taste is a mix of tart notes with some funky Brett notes and a vinous finish with light oak. Body is about average for style with good carbonation and no perceptible alcohol. Enjoyable saison with a nice level of complexity.,"Jan 02, 2023"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Texas,4.51/5,"Pours soft hazy yellow/straw with a massive head and great retention. Nose is primarily brett, lemon, oak, but smells fantastic. Taste is similar to the nose a light tartness from the lemon and hay, funk from the brett, and balance from the oak. The flavors all blend together wonderfully to form a fantastic saison. The mouthfeel is soft and pillowy. Each taste of the slight tartness invites additional sipping. Just a wonderful farmhouse ale.","Nov 23, 2022"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,California,4.32/5,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention. 

Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well. 

Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.

Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.

Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.","May 21, 2022"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,California,4.65/5,"On tap at Windsor Homebrew in Anaheim, CA.

Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all. 

I am lost. I am found. I am. I just am.","Mar 16, 2022"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Connecticut,4.36/5,"No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21

Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.

Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.

Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.

A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.","Jan 01, 2022"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Indiana,4.46/5,"Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head. 

Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent. 

Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish. 

Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish. 

Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.","Dec 31, 2021"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Hong Kong,4.49/5,"A 750ml bottle, with no bottled on or best before date (although I’m pretty sure it’s either B1 or B2). Poured into a Tilquin stemmed glass.

Appearance: A hazy golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass, while leaving some lacing.

Aroma: Funky, barnyard, minerals, light tartness, tropical stone fruit, apricot, unripe berries, green apple, citrus, grapefruit, lemon peel, oak, a touch of grains, with slight pepper notes.

Taste: Tart, tropical and citrus fruity, grapefruit, apricot, green apple, light funk, oak, vinous, with a lightly spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to try it fresh, but this bottle having aged 6 / 7 years, has aged gracefully with wonderful complex yet balanced aroma and flavours.","Aug 26, 2021"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Pennsylvania,4.37/5,"A bit of a gusher. Pours clear, dark gold with strong effervescence and three fingers of rocky, meringue-like, yellowed head. Decent retention gives way to thick, webbed lacing.

A little lemon and mixed fruit, clear wood, a hint of must and some pepper in the very enticing aroma.

Sour lemon again up front in the taste. Certainly tart, but without being an enamel stripper. Balanced somewhat by the strong wood, a little funk and again just a hint of mixed fruit sweetness. Maybe a little mineral water or clay in the finish.

Very soft feel. A touch more heft than expected. Soft, tickley carbonation.

A beautifully crafted beer from start to finish. A little more robust than some super refined beers, while still managing to expertly balance the sourness, tartness, funk and wood. A real treat.","Jul 09, 2021"

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Hawaii,4.5/5,Solid representation of oak BA saison,"Jan 02, 2021"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Oregon,4.49/5,"Bottle from The Beermongers. Thanks, Sam!

A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure. 

The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes. Drying, mildly tannic and earthy on the finish, long lasting with firm acidity. Light in body, crisply carbonated, nicely structured. Impressive.","Dec 25, 2020"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,California,4.76/5,"Bottle picked up from brewery today. 
Golden deep copper. Moderate head with lacing. Bubbly. 
Bretty tart oaky nose. +Yogurt, vanilla. 
Tastes similar to other SARA saisons. Definite tart peach or apricot notes. Tart, lemon, with a little funk. Minerals, yogurt, apples. As expected, more flavors keep showing up as it warms. 
Textbook saison body and dry tart finish. 
Very nice.
Follow up current batch #11: bought June ‘21. Just amazing saison in every respect.","Oct 27, 2020"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Virginia,4.49/5,"A: Pours a light pale/blond with a thick two-inch cap of bright white, sudsy foam. Very good clarity and retention. Not gonna lie—it kinda looks like a lager (at least the first pour; subsequent ones were cloudier).

S: Light lemon, hay, wet earth and leather, crackery malt, dried jasmine. Appealing and well balanced.

T: Follows the nose with lemon, light earthy and leathery funk, green apple, dried flowers, and crackery malt. Long finish with mild malty lemony sweetness and mild tang.

M: Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Toeing the line of being crisp.

O: Super drinkable refreshing. A well constructed saison that’s perfect for the warmer months.","Jun 03, 2020"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Minnesota,4.49/5,"2020 vintage, drank February 18th, 2020. Sadly, this bottle leaked quite a bit in transit - carb was nearly absent, but the taste and nose were terrific. Light bodied, tart, and super smooth with that low carb. It reminded me a bit of a geuze, minus the apple notes. It's only mildly sour and just a bit funky. I really liked this one - wish it hadn't leaked so heavily!","Mar 06, 2020"

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Massachusetts,4.25/5,"Picked up a bottle to-go at the brewery, enjoyed a few hours later.

Golden hue with a thin head that fades quickly. Light effervescence.

Dry and acidic, nothing jammy or enamel-striping-tart.

Light, refined, prickly but not sharp.","Feb 18, 2019"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,California,4.54/5,"On tap Toronado SD, into a chalice. 

Straw-yellow in color, slightly hazy with a small wispy head, dissapating quickly. Nose is of lemons and unripe berries, touch of funky oak. Flavors follow, if not slightly more fruit-forward, with a hint of cherry sweetness midsip. Quick, crisp, tart finish with lingering notes of sour apple. 

Kinda of a legendary brew here in CA, I remember tasting this at the Firestone Invitational some years ago, nice to be able to do a proper review.","Feb 05, 2019"

It is lightly tart, with lemon, pineapple, earthy funk, and floral. The feel is medium. A great Saison from Sante Adairus.","Aug 04, 2018"
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,,Germany,5/5,"Has a very barrel forward nose, defined by leather, wet basement, moldy wood and yogurt. The interesting thing about this is, that there is a recognizable freshness, coming from the base beer, at the same time. It provides aromas of lemon zest, soft wheat and dried herbs, building up a perfectly enjoyable collision.

Has a fine effervescence with a light, sour and dry body, making this remarkably refreshing, with a nice smoothness to it.

Tastes of an initial flavor explosion on the palate, mellowed by a pleasant yeast silkness, enriching unripe grapefruits, kiwi pulp, mushrooms and blue cheese amongst warming campfire wood. Turns a tad sweeter, with toffee joining in, highlighting the oranges by adding a fruity sweetness, entagled into the oak. This gets softened by an aqueous quality, producing just a light hint of spices, perfectly integrating lemon zest and a late herb dryness with some prevailing mushrooms. 

Incredibly well nuanced beer with an absolutely astonishing complexity, while it drinks almost too easy with a world class mouthfeel. This may be the closest thing i‘ve yet enjoyed so far to a belgian saison / lambic from the US and puts up this brewery with the very best in the world for me.","Jul 25, 2018"

S: Funky, deep, complex - saison funk, yeast funk, barnyard funk - light tartness - lemon - flowery and floral - light grains, light sweetness - loads of wood, rich oak - layers of funk

T: Bright saison funk and tartness - farmhouse weirdness including some damp cellar and straw - some brighter acidity and lemon - flowery - some pear, green apple - rich oak, chewy wood - light sweetness with some lingering funk

M: Medium body, medium carbonation, crisp with lingering tart funk 

O: Cellarman is the hero Gotham deserves

Cellarman flirts with almost being too funky to be a saison, but it does not cross any lines (not that anyone is really too concerned). It's bright, it's tart, it's like drinking a barn.","Aug 24, 2017"

Magnificent looking beer. Dark brown body with a massive off white head. This is replenished by swarms of carbonation up the side of the tulip, leaving gobs of lacing.

Malty aroma with a lingering sweetness. Also, a faint funkiness.

On tasting, well, so smooth. Abv well hidden. Tons of dark fruit, light sweetness. Takes some restraint not to gulp it down.

Mouth full, finish is where the abv makes an appearance, mixed with plum and raisin notes.

Best by 4/13/26

I found this , to my surprise, to be a bit of a let down. It was less malty sweet and more tangy sharp than I expected, thinner too. I still found it enjoyable but have found other Quads more to my liking (perhaps they were overly sweet for style). Maybe it was just an off day for my palate so I will revisit and compare notes.","May 06, 2023"

T - The taste is of course the stand out. Very complex. very bitter and earthy. Possibly the most earthy stout I've ever had. I personally enjoy more sweet stouts where this is very very bitter and woody. However, I believe the complexity and richness speaks to the craft and would be absolutely loved by some.

The Abyss,,Washington,4.96/5,"Aged leather gives way to notes of strong, dark licorice. There are notes of burnt marshmallow in there, as well as a taste of either ripe plums or fresh Mediterranean figs. With an ABV of over 11%, this beer does not come off as overly boozy, despite its aging in bourbon and French oak barrels. Finally, there is a finish of sarsaparilla and milky molasses. 

This beer will only get better with age. I see this beer as mellowing its edges with another year or two (if you can wait that long), on the shelf, aging.","Apr 07, 2023"

The Abyss,,New Jersey,4.06/5,"Unsure of the 99 rating. Wasn't impressed a year ago, and not impressed a year after proper aging. Dark chocolate and leather are present but there is a ""burnt"" characteristic to this that just turns me off. Some astringency as well.

The Abyss,,,4.34/5,"Drinking a 2018 bottle (cellared). This RIS has a roasted malt or grain characteristic which sets it apart from some of the others. It is not a sweet beer with lots of cherries, plums, or fruits. Rather, it is a dry, dark and burnt character leaning towards tart/bitter end of the scale for me. It is like a dry RIS. I like it. More of the bitter Chocolate and Coffee end of the spectrum. It is mellow, and not boozy (for me). Mouth feel is medium, and not too chewy. Just right actually. Looks like motor oil from an old V8 that has not been drained in 20k miles. Reaching for my 2nd one just now. This is a quality product from Deschutes.","Jan 26, 2023"
The Abyss,,Connecticut,4.28/5,"2017 Reserve. Bottled on 10/13/17. Pulled this bottle out my cellar. Was not sure what to expect, but...it is still tasting great! I suspect that the wax over the bottle cap along with the hefty ABV helped. Pours jet black with a frothy coffee colored head. Some slight hints of this beers age come through in the nose, but not enough to be offensive. As many other reviews state, there is a lot going on in this offering. Every sip offers up a new flavor or aroma that I did not pick out in the previous. The barrel aged flavor complements this beer instead of overpowering it. The nose is the only hint that this beer has just over 5 years on it. Overall, an enjoyable and complex imperial stout.","Nov 17, 2022"

The aroma is moderate in strength featuring chocolate, roasted malt and oak barrel. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more subtle oak, bitter chocolate and a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. The substantial ABV is well hidden. Overall, very good.","Apr 10, 2022"
The Abyss,,Idaho,4.27/5,"No head. Smell is rich dark chocolate, cherry, hints of coffee and bourbon. Lots going on in the mouth— upfront cherry, milk and dark chocolate, hoppy pine bitterness, caramel, oak char, coffee on the finish, and a bit more hops.

Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?","Aug 21, 2021"
The Abyss,,Pennsylvania,4.58/5,"Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess. 
If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking. 
It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!
It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say. 
The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say. 
You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it. 
It’s good. As I have said here before, better does exist. BBA Darkness, for example. But Abyss is lovely!","Aug 05, 2021"

The Abyss,,Pennsylvania,4.17/5,"Crowler split with a friend. Picked up at Sabatinis in Exeter Pa a week ago 

Looks decent enough in a large wine glass. Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing.

Faintly boozy aroma, almost RIS-like. A little molasses, faint smoke.

On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy.

Mouth between medium and full, finish a warm boozy roast.

Overall, not as good as I hoped, roast a bit much for this palate.","Jun 19, 2021"
The Abyss,,Hong Kong,4.38/5,"A 22 fl. oz. bomber, 2016 Reserve, bottled on 8th December 2016. Poured into a snifter glass.

Appearance: Very dark brown to black in colour with a nice one finger brown head that had decent retention, while leaving lots of nice spotty lacing.

Aroma: Dark malt, moderate roast, chocolate, sweet notes, licorice, molasses, bourbon, oak.

Taste: Light bitterness, roasted malts, dark chocolate, light char, sweet notes, brown sugar, licorice, molasses, oak and bourbon on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, full bodied with soft carbonation.

Overall: An excellent classic Imperial Stout with lots of great flavours and not too sweet. A wonderful and enjoyable sipper.","Jun 09, 2021"
The Abyss,,Nevada,4.84/5,"Wow, that is a powerful smell. It's a combination of wood, cocoa, licorice and alcohol but mostly the cocoa wood.

OK the wood and dark chocolate come through first and then deep pungent bitterness. 

It's a full bodied stout.  There is carbonation but it barely cuts through the thickness. The alcohol is warming. It finishes dry and bitter.

It's fantastic. If you want an extremely powerful stout without a hint of whiskey, this couldn't be more perfect. It gets a 5.8 out of 6 not a perfect score because it's almost overpowering but still great.","May 08, 2021"

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Massachusetts,4.23/5,"Drank from a 1 pint can purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
2022
Served in a Tree House Brewing Company tulip

The beer poured a syrupy and rather intense looking pitch black hue. An inch-tall, tight and creamy, mocha colored crown topped the liquid and slowly fell to a thick, lasting collar. Streaks and drops of lacing stuck all along the sides of the glass.

The aroma was decent initially and definitely improved with time. Moderately roasty with day-old coffee notes. Bit of acrid character and perhaps some raw cocoa too. As the beer sat, sweet, creamy lactose notes appeared. Good dose of vanilla as well. Chocolate syrup was also noticeable. The sweetness and the chocolate character intensified as the beer sat.

The flavor profile was also solid but perhaps not as smooth as the nose. Malty and robust up front. Roasted malts were most apparent. Moderate caramel malt presence too. Cold coffee was also noticeable. Subtle lactose and vanilla notes were detectable in the center. Slightly sweet. More roastiness on the back end and the finish. Moderate amount of bitterness. Some alcohol warmth came through as well.

Nice creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. Slightly syrupy. The liquid contained a finer beaded, somewhat prickly effervescent that turned fluffy on the palate.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be is an enjoyable beer, though not as impressive as its ratings might suggest. Both the flavor profile and the mouthfeel came across as a bit flat. I feel like many of Tree House’s imperial milk stouts definitely suffered in quality when they moved from bottles into cans.","Oct 29, 2022"

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,New Jersey,4.33/5,"Pours black, significant brown head. It definitely has that milk stout aroma - tangy/lactose and some alcohol.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,New Jersey,4.04/5,"Pours like syrup--smooth and sweet. Very dark brown with a mocha head. It is rich with strong milk chocolate flavor, and subtle coffee flavor underneath.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Massachusetts,3.4/5,"16oz can poured into a snifter.

A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings.

S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee.

T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish. 

M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.

O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now.","Sep 05, 2020"
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Colorado,4/5,"Ok, to start off, this is sweet. It does smell like cocoa powder, almost like opening a packet of swiss miss. Flavor is like lactose, dark chocolate, and hershey's syrup. Overall a bit too sweet for me but an interesting beer.","Sep 02, 2020"

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Massachusetts,4.52/5,"Canned 7/11/20 (I think, the stamping was very compressed and distorted)

Once again shifting away from their hoppy portfolio, we have a highly regarded milk stout that was included in the mixed case I got

Pours completely pitch black with a massive 3 fingers of espresso colored head that fades slowly to a cap and leaves patchy lacing

In the nose, I pick up rich milk chocolate, roasty coffee, vanilla, and subtle hints of dark fruit, toffee, and cinnamon. A very enticing aroma here

Up front in the taste I get a nice balance of char and sweet chocolate. On the swallow, it become evident why this is a milk stout. Layered with juicy raisin, rich chocolate, and light coffee roast, this is sweet but absolutely fucking brilliant

This has a medium full body with light tingly carbonation, leading to a finish that is a touch sticky and sweet. The relatively low alcohol content almost feels like a joke, as this drinks like a beer that is over 10%

Well, it’s certainly true when they say this drinks bigger than it actually is. I’m floored by the way they coax huge flavors out of something with such a low abv. Bravo guys, this exceeds some of their IPAs","Jul 30, 2020"
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Kentucky,4.68/5,One of the best stouts I've ever had. Just so drinkable. Creamy coffee and chocolate just dance on the palate like a fluffy pillow. Outstanding. My rear end would need its own zip code if I had ready access to this.,"May 09, 2020"
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Illinois,4.41/5,"16oz can, dated 11.27.19, poured into a Tree House snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, very thick and viscous with a finger or so of caramel colored head that has modest retention and yields a spot or two of lacing. The aroma is excellent, rich chocolate, fudge, brownie batter, chocolate syrup, smooth coffee roast, a bit of sweet cream, vanilla and rich dark grains. The flavors are great, bursting with rich chocolate, lots of fudge, brownie batter and tons of chocolate syrup while there is great layer of smooth but roasted coffee underneath that plays well with the toasted grains and compliments the sweet cream and vanilla aspects of the beer. The mouthfeel is incredible, super luscious with a thick and heavy body that coats extremely well and is so smooth with a creamy finish.

Verdict: A stunning stout from Tree House. The flavor profile feels like that of a 10%+ ABV beer, it's bursting with chocolate and the mouthfeel is so incredible for a beer this size and the layers of coffee and cream round this one out for a very sweet and rich dessert style beer.","Jan 06, 2020"
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,North Carolina,4.2/5,"Appearance: A massive bubble show here, producing a two finger tan head over the espresso colored liquid; splotchy lacing

Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy with low to moderate carbonation

Pours a nice, luxurious head with great retention. Deep, slick color. Nose is milk chocolate, fudge and cream. Very aromatic. Simple but this is exactly the aroma I expect from the style. Beer opens soft and almost pillowy. I get notes of sweet soy sauce, chocolate, fudge and roasted malt. A nice creaminess in the middle with some vanilla and molasses. Ends more sweet soy sauce and almost a touch of tartness from the roast. Very solid. Body is medium with low carbonation. Slick but fluffy on the palate and goes down oily with a long, lingering finish. This one drinks much bigger than it is... which is great.

All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,,Massachusetts,4.59/5,"Prepping for a wedding, hopefully this is a good luck charm.

A- Tallboy pours into a tall chalice with a black as the midnight sky body and a very, very dark cocoa powder hue to the cap. The crown shoots up to an inch high with very good retention and a thick, frothy-foamy texture. Thick coral-esque webs of lacing.

S- Cocoa, cocoa, cocoa. Rich, bitter and semi-sweet chocolate dominates the aroma alongside some of the other roasty things like the charred barley and some dark roast coffee beans. Chocolate syrup, sweet milk chocolate bars, fudge, slight dark fruits, milk and cookies, fruity very dark chocolate and a hint of toasted nuts.

T- The sweetness makes a bit of a difference here as things shift more towards a rich, semi-dark milk chocolate bar type of flavor alongside that chocolate syrup and less of the bitter dark chocolate bars and baking cocoa. Rather sweet but still balanced by the coffee, chocolate and roast malt bitterness. Toffee, caramel, chocolate milk, malted milk balls, roast barley, chocolate malt, toasted nuts, fudge, chocolate truffles and cookies come to mind. Extremely rich for the ABV.

MF- Again and again Tree House dominates mouthfeel. Thick, luscious and heavy with a high level of carbonation that creams up beautifully on the palate. A touch bitter in the finish but a lot of sweetness to counteract that.

There is actually a fairly strong amount of coffee in the flavor but wow does the cocoa shine in this beer. It is about as far as you can take chocolate in a beer before it becomes too much with wonderful sweet milk chocolate, fudge, fruity dark chocolate and cocoa nib flavors. A 6.5% dessert that packs about as much flavor as it possibly could.","Oct 03, 2019"

Abraxas,,Germany,3.94/5,"Pours an opaque, pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and strong milk chocolate and cinnamon aromas, with hints of vanilla coming through as well. Taste follows the nose, with a poor balance of roasted, caramel malt and strong chocolate and cinnamon notes, with the cinnamon standing out particularly, as well as some vanilla and just the merest hint of chilis. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness, light bitterness and some cinnamon and chocolate lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and carbonation.

BA Abraxas has got to be the most overrated stout that I have ever tasted and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the same goes for the base version which suffers from exactly the same poor balance that I already disliked for the barrel-aged version. It's basically a total cinnamon bomb, the cinnamon being WAY too overdone here and pretty much drowning out everything else except the chocolate, which only underlines the sweetness of the cinnamon. There's hints of vanilla as well, but next to no chili heat coming through, which this would have desperately needed to balance out that sweetness. At least the roasted malts and a light bitterness in the finish prevent this from becoming quite too cloyingly sweet, but I have had plenty of much better Mexican Imperial Stouts and the hype that surrounds this beer absolutely mystifies me. I will say that the body and mouthfeel are indeed very nice here, rich and velvety, while the chilis seem to come out just a little bit more as this warms. Also, the ABV is very well-hidden, this drinking surprisingly smooth and mellow. This is by no means a bad beer, just feels more like a Pastry Stout than a Mexican Stout to me.","Jul 08, 2023"
Abraxas,,Missouri,4.53/5,"2022 vintage. Cacao and a hint of chili on the nose. Taking a first sip, the cacao really pops. A light chili and cinnamon aftertaste follows. The chili isn't spicy, but it's flavorful.

This is a fantastic imperial stout. At first, I thought this might be a little too sweet, but as I drink more, it's really not. The sweetness does a great job of balancing out the bitterness of the baker's chocolate as well as the cinnamon and I can see why they did it. I might have dialed it back just a hair, but that's a nitpick.

FULL bodied. Nice and thick, like an imperial stout should be. Almost chewy. As the beer gets warmer, the cinnamon gets more noticeable.

Long after a sip, vanilla takes center stage as it lingers on the tongue with the cacao, chili and cinnamon still noticeable in the background. Wonderful.

Overall, this is one of the very best imperial stouts I've had. Excellent job. I will buy a few more of these and see how they age, assuming I can keep them around for a few years without drinking them first.","Jun 30, 2023"

Bought a bomber of this beer at the brewery this past March. I decided to have it for Father’s Day!

Smell of dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla and chili pepper. Follows to the taste. Initially the flavors of fresh stone fruit contributed. This transitioned to stronger chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla. The chili also becomes stronger as it warms. Apricot and cream, seriously. Pleasant booze and malt background. Flavors are so nicely woven together. Luxuriant smooth feel.

Very pleasant and melded aromas. Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, vanilla, and cashew.

Roasty but sweet malts on the tip of the tongue. Coffee and nutty/vanilla notes in midstream. Bitterness boosts here to the end. The cinnamon gives way to the ancho warmth at the finish. Hides the booze well.

Medium-full bodied but not quite chewy. Modest carbonation but not sticky or cloying.

The flavors are bold but extremely mellow and well-balanced. The mouth feel is soft and velvety with low/moderate carbonation, and the 11.5% ABV is not distracting in the least.

Abraxas,,Connecticut,4.34/5,"Im sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle poured into my snifter. Beer is part of a BIF winnings from the NFL BIF 33, I think. 
Beer was received last fall (2021) and has been in my cellar till today. I think it is a 2019 vintage.
The beer pours a jet black color with a fluffy tan head foaming up 2 cm even with a gentle pour. This foam slowly fades to a sturdy edge layer after the pour.
Aroma on this brew is rich dark chocolate, fudge brownie, cinnamon notes and some earthy slightly spicy pepper notes. No hint of hops nor the ABV of this beer.
First sip from the glass reveals a medium body with fine tingly carbonation and a silky texture. The mouthfeel is a little less full than I expected, but this seems a nice stout on physical traits.
Flavor is roasted malts, dark chocolate, and fudge. I then get some cinnamon and peppery notes, with very mild tingly warmth buried in the background. This warmth does show up again on the burps on the beer. I never get any hint of the ABV and hops are absent on flavor profile too.

The different years were different prices so i just bought the oldest and most expensive one which was a 2020. $25. Worth a try. Poured into a snifter and man that head just disappeared as soon as i poured it. Color was dark brown. The smell is sweet like cocoa and coffee, with a tinge of spiciness to it that tingles the nose a bit. Taste is rich and velvety, warm smooth melting chocolate and a slight bitterness of coffee. Yes the cinnamon is also there enriching the experience. I'm looking for more chili pepper in the beer. It's slight but not nearly strong enough to get my top marks. I like it when the beer bites back. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full, bubbling only the slightest bit. Another reviewer compared this to Christmas Bomb and Xocoveza, and having had both those beers, I would say this rates pretty highly up there with both of those brews. Overall this is an awesome beer, and definitely one of the better stouts i've tried. There's nothing spectacularly unique about it, but as far as a stout goes, this sets the bar pretty high, manifesting what a stout can be if it's done well and done right. Cheers!","Jul 23, 2022"

Abraxas,,New York,4.26/5,"Got this bottle in December 2017 and the age mellowed out the alcohol burn. It poured as black as ink with a small brown head that faded slowly and left basically zero lacing. It smells of cinnamon, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and roasted peppers up front, followed by cocoa powder, brown sugar, charred wood and cooking spices. The ABV was quite subdued in the nose.

Tastes of dark chocolate and smoked chili peppers up front, followed by cinnamon, milk chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, roasted grains, cocoa powder, brown sugar, molasses, red wine, charred wood and cooking spices. The flavor has a lot of smoky, charred aspects but still does down easy like a well aged bourbon. The char and oaky components give it some hints of vanilla and campfire smoke, while covering up the ABV. Pretty smooth drinking for a heavy stout, this was quite enjoyable.","May 06, 2022"

Abraxas,,Massachusetts,4.49/5,"Crowler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, unknown vintage but presumably the latest release from 2021

Yet another legendary Stout acquired at Half Time yesterday! The difference in rankings between this and the barrel aged version of it is shocking to me, at #245 vs #3, respectively. Still, I’m expecting a quality beer with this one. Let’s get into it

Pours jet black with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The peppery spice in the nose is really nice, it combines well with everything. I’m picking up on aromas of chipotle pepper, earthy cinnamon, roasty coffee, milk chocolate, spicy whiskey, light raisin, and vanilla

The balance carries over into taste, with the pepper adding a nice but firm spice. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, chili pepper, dates, and vanilla. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, vanilla, spicy whiskey, roasty coffee, and toasted oak

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness

This is a very good beer. The balance is really nice and nothing is overwhelming. I can’t wait to try the BA version","Mar 27, 2022"
Abraxas,,South Dakota,4.48/5,"Perennial Abraxas Imperial Stout 2021, 11.5% ABV. Pours black and thick with a one-finger medium brown head that left no lacing but the cap lingered.

Excellent smooth and thick mouthfeel, overall world class. Way better than Prairie Bomb or Stone Xocoveza.","Mar 06, 2022"
Abraxas,,Illinois,3.93/5,great mixture of flavors - can't taste the chill peppers mostly cocoa flavor comes thru,"Jan 25, 2022"
Abraxas,,Ohio,4.79/5,"If you're a fan of Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, then congrats - you're already a fan of Abraxas.

A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing.

Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb, but smoother and more refined.

Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey. Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action.

The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, smooth delight. Very light carbonation.

I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed.","Dec 26, 2021"

I like the aroma, the brew smells like Ancho chilies, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, cacao nibs and some earthiness. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some dark bread, coffee and burnt/charred malt flavors. I think all the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and coating with a low/moderate amount of carbonation.

It was just as good as the first time. The only beer I've had that's similar in taste to this is Firestone-Walker's Mole Merkin. There's a ton of flavor in this beer but they all mix together quite wonderfully. This is one of my favorite beers, I'm big on stouts and this one is up there with the best of em . Update for 2021-2022 version, it was as good as the first time I've tried it. One of my all time favorite beers, I can't recommended it enough!

The head recedes to a thin ring and little else. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring candi sugar, raisin, bourbon and leather. The taste is semisweet caramel, bourbon and brown sugar with lingering tobacco, oak and leather on the finish. Minimal bitterness.

Presented flat. No foam at all. Deep brown, borders on black.
Smells great. Dark stone fruits and that famiiar Quad on the nose.
Taste is toes on the line too sweet, but it doesn’t become cloying or teeth-achingly so. I think maybe because it’s 7 years old, some if the nuances intended have been lost. But the dark brown sugar, stewed plums and oak barrel all make appearances throughout the chew.
Feel is very dense, quite viscous, no carbonation.

Stickee Monkee,,Minnesota,4.44/5,"2021 Vintage consumed on 10-30-2022

A bit of smoke on the opening of the bottle. Dark brown pouring with a 2 finger tan head, with a fairly aggressive pour. The retention is decent, and there's some lacing on the glass. 
The aroma is strong with dark fruit - I get a lot of plum and raisin in the nose. 
Taste - Tons of plum and raisin hit up front. There's a hint of caramel and toffee on the back. I also get a creamy flavor mixing in, almost a lactose flavor. This last thing surprised me, probably not getting it right. 
The body is very thick and full. Smooth, and very little alcohol burn. 
I love this beer, and so glad I bought it.","Oct 30, 2022"
Stickee Monkee,,California,4.22/5,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.

The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.","Sep 18, 2022"

Stickee has always been a favorite for me. I love a great quad and Firestone does an amazing job adding a barrel aged component. The nose is wonderful. The barrel is prominent and it’s perfectly sweet. I don’t know what the aging has done to this bottle. It’s super smooth but was it harsh before? I doubt it. I’d probably drink this fresh in the future. A world class beer and perhaps the best quad you can find? One day I’ll find a Westy 12 to test that theory.","May 23, 2021"

S: Smells of tons of dark fruits, caramel and toffee along with a nice touch of oak
T: Taste is caramel and toffee up front before some dark fruits come in. Nice bready malt with a huge amount of sugary sweetness along with some hints of oak and vanilla. On the swallow there's more brown sugar sweetness, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, oak, and vanilla.
M: This beer is on the heavier side of things with a silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is soft but adequate for the style while the ABV ensures that this beer has a dying finish.
O: Overall this beer rocks the house. A huge amount of complexity makes this a beer that demands to be sipped and savored. Alcohol is hidden very well. It's also held up very well to the test of time and shows no signs of off flavors.","Apr 09, 2021"

The aroma is easily detected, with black cherry, brown sugar, molasses and bourbon. Oooh - great mouthfeel! Body is nearly full, and chewy. And the brew is silky smooth when traversing the tongue.

Samuel Adams Utopias,,Ohio,4.45/5,"2017 vintage - shared with me from a friend. Small 2oz pour for each of us. Served in a small 4oz snifter tasting glass.

Appearance: Clear dark amber-copper color. No lacing (there wouldn't be at this ABV). 

Smell: Boozy - bourbon barrel notes, honey, toffee. Rich. 

Taste: Lots going on. Definitely some barleywine notes, with some bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee, honey, orange, raisin, and some bitter notes at the finish as well. 

Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth for something this high in alcohol. Good thickness, no carbonation, dry finish, and only a little warming. 

Overall / Drinkability: I can see why some people describe this a more like a brandy than a beer, and I almost want to call it a Barleybrandy. It's got aspects of a Barleywine, but so much more.

Smokey wood and tobacco, raisin/plum schnapps?, plenty of brown liquor, hints of vanilla and honey, plus...just so much more. The body is wonderfully sticky and viscous.

Samuel Adams Utopias,,California,4.72/5,"This is my review of the 2021 edition of Utopias. I regret missing missing the previous editions, this is my first. With much anticipation I waited for my local Total Wine to show it in stock & rushed over to hesitantly with $240. I’m more than a bit thrifty but I wanted to try this legendary brew. I ordered proper glassware to serve this ‘“beer”. Poured into a Glencairn whiskey glass, the headless, reddish liquid was a perfect match of the mahogany trim on my Stressless recliner. Aroma, I can’t imagine anything prettier, it would make a great perfume: bourbon, sherry, wine, caramel, maple & an abundance of barrel aromas. Flavor: far more complex flavors than my meeker palate can discern but here are few I can pick out, bourbon, wine, caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla with maple & tart cherries at the finish. There is no carbonation but plenty of alcohol, this definitely a sipper. It is delicious & it’s aroma is heavenly. Is it worth the high price? Probably not. Will I try another in future? Probably, at least one more. Besides, it matches my furniture.","Apr 13, 2022"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,,4.54/5,"Is this a beer? Convince me! I bit the bullet when my local brew shop procured a trio of these for customers with more cash than sense. I've still got the bottle here on my desk, and it's a good way to start conversations with fellow hop heads.

Zero head, zero carbonation. A dark amber color that smells like a strong port. It tastes kind of like a port that was made from raisins and maple syrup instead of grapes. The mouthfeel is weirdly oily, probably due to the use of maple syrup in the brewing process. Best enjoyed in moderation, because it's gone before you know it.

I'm glad I had the experience, but I can't see myself getting it again. It's just way too expensive for what you get. The oily character was a little off-putting to me, and while I liked the strong raisin flavor, I wasn't as fond of the maple. And in no way is it experienced like something you'd call ""beer."" You take careful shots, there's no carbonation, and it's stronger than many cocktails.

It's probably not fair for me to call it ""overrated,"" and given the expense of brewing it, I can't quite say it's overpriced. But the experience was more costly than it was worth for me.","Dec 15, 2021"

The strong booze coats the tongue first, followed by mounds of sweet maple and molasses, becomes quite reminiscent of whiskey, some notes of vanilla and a light cinnamon, don't get a tone of the cherry but a very slight note of them. Once again the booze is noticeable and drinks a lot more like hard liquor than beer.

F:. No carbonation, creamy smooth, strong heat from the alcohol

O:. This is a very interesting beer and very good, but too me it doesn't quite live up to the price or the hype.","Nov 13, 2021"

Here we are BA, my personal whale. Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up

Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs

It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey

This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa

A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet

This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it. To good beer and better freiends!","Oct 01, 2021"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Massachusetts,3.91/5,"Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have.","Oct 01, 2021"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Minnesota,4.97/5,"2007 vintage - First opened July 4, 2021 - Review on July 6, 2021. 

This beer looks thick as heck while pouring. It's a red/brown color coming from the bottle. There's no head at all, which doesn't surprise me one bit, based on the age and ABV. 
The nose is out of this world. In a way, to me, it smells like a fine bourbon. Very boozy, first off. I get tons of caramel, toffee, chocolate, raisin, plum, and so much more that I can't fully describe. This is an outstanding aroma. 
Taste - I know I won't do justice to this - Chocolate is up front, as is the raisin and plum. It then goes to the back to toffee and caramel. I'm also getting vanilla in the mix. This is really only a small portion of the flavors I'm getting overall, but I just can't put words to them. 
Body - Up front there's a bit of a burn from the alcohol, but WAY less than the ABV would suggest. It then turns to a smooth, almost creamy feeling, that is so smooth and easy drinking. 
This is worth the hype, and I'm so happy I got the chance to get a bottle. Being in the liquor business now, I'm going to try to get another the next time it comes out, just to see the difference between vintages.","Jul 06, 2021"

Samuel Adams Utopias,,Massachusetts,4.71/5,"It's the Port wine of the beer world, well sort of. It drinks more like a liquor than a beer, no carbonation, no creamy head just a viscous high alcohol punch in the sinuses. It's a great beer to experience if you can get enough folks to split the cost because this bottle ain't cheap.","Mar 19, 2021"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Norway,3.93/5,"Sample from bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Beautiful chestnut colour. No carbonation, and accordingly no head. INTENSE aroma of port wine, dark dried fruits and fusel alcohols. The latter unfortunately detracts from the aroma score. Intense, concentrated and sweet flavour of old madeira, raisins / rum-raisin and oak.","Mar 18, 2021"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Massachusetts,4.44/5,"I've only had this at Extreme Beer Fest. I wouldn't usually go for something like this, but it is legend. My endorsement of it is that I immediately got back in line for another taste, which I didn't do for too many others at Extreme.","Feb 19, 2021"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Maine,4.68/5,"Why this is defined as a beer I have NO idea as it should be a liquor. Amazing alcohol content and it is certainly in my face. I had heard a lot about it and am certainly glad I was able to try it but would never shell out that kind of money to buy it. If it was $25/bottle I still would be unlikely to buy it unless I served it as an after dinner drink kind of thing. Sounds like I didn’t like it, I did, but it’s a niche beer for my tastes and it’s just not a niche I need.","Sep 13, 2020"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,New York,4.74/5,There is a great balance between a raisiny and balanced sweetness as well as a barleywine type flavor. This comes with a screwtop so is almost like drinking a bottle of scotch or bourbon.,"May 04, 2020"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Ohio,4.6/5,"From the 2016 Vintage bottle in a Seventh Son taster via Bluejacket---Cheers!

This bucket list brew pours a lovely peach tinged cognac color with a 
nice set of fantastic legs with a slight swirl.....ZZTop would be proud!
Nose of brandy, cognac, subtle cherry, raisin, strong astringent booze, 
peach, and pear.....exceedingly complex, hard to describe. Almost buttery.
Flavors excel with spiced pear and peach brandy doused in cognac and 
subtle bourbon flavors with touches of oak and hints of vanilla. Orange 
zest and wine arise and fade on the rear with touches of apricot and 
faint herbal hop notes with tart cherry notes. Mouth feel is warming, smooth,
no carbonation (duh!), medium body that coats, and a dry finish.

Overall, a fantastic brew worthy of a taste, but only a taste....too much 
would set one over the edge. 

Complex, interesting, and highly unique.

Thanks Bluejacket!

Cheers!","Jan 11, 2020"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,New York,4.99/5,"Served in a tiny snifter. Dark amber with no carbonation or head. Smells of a fine tawny port, caramel, toffee. Taste is the same with a hint of vanilla.","Jan 06, 2020"
Samuel Adams Utopias,,Michigan,4.89/5,"This was an awesome experience, Finding the unicorn and then getting to taste it made my New Years Day extra special. I never thought that I would ever have this and then i did, The flavor is rich and delicious. I tasted a hint of fruit/caramel maybe, definitely decadent. This has made it's way to the #1 all time spot on my list. I don't believe anything will ever come close.","Jan 02, 2020"
